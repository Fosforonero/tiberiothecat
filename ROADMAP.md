# SplitVote — Roadmap

> Piattaforma globale di behavioral data gamificata.
> Dilemmi morali in tempo reale → profili morali → loop virali → insight aggregati.

Ultimo aggiornamento: 25 Maggio 2026 — `DILEMMA-EDITORIAL-SHAPE-GATE-01` shipped (local). AI dilemma-generation prompt now forces a "conflict-shaped dilemma" framing (do not ask whether the topic is good/bad — transform into a collision between two defensible fears with explicit costs) and requires the `rationale` field to name the value collision. Quality gate adds four moral-only soft warnings (`abstract_policy_question`, `support_oppose_framing`, `undefined_collective_actor`, `undefined_action_verb`) that catch referendum-style framings like "Se un Paese rifiuta regole sull'AI, gli altri dovrebbero rallentare comunque?" — suppressed when the question carries an explicit tradeoff marker ("più pericoloso ... o ...", "ma raddoppia ... quale ingiustizia accetti", "which cost do you accept"). 8 new vitest cases (21 total in the file). Lifestyle remains exempt. No autopublish / save-mode / Redis / Supabase / legal change.

## 25 May 2026 — Dilemma Editorial Shape Gate

PM trigger: Matteo flagged the generated IT dilemma "Se un Paese rifiuta regole sull'AI, gli altri dovrebbero rallentare comunque?" as boring yes/no policy polling — not the conflict-shaped tradeoffs SplitVote promises. Editorial audit recorded in `reports/dilemma-editorial-audit-2026-05-25.md`. Sprint executed per `SPRINT: DILEMMA-EDITORIAL-SHAPE-GATE-01`.

### Shipped (local — awaits PM GO to commit + push)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `lib/content-generation-prompts.ts` | Added two new `SAFETY_RULES` items: (1) "conflict-shaped dilemma" — do not ask should-X-be-good/bad; transform topic into a collision between two defensible fears with costs on both sides; both options must read as serious positions, not yes/no labels. (2) "avoid vague referendum framing" — replace broad collective actors + vague action verbs with concrete actors + specific actions. Strengthened the `rationale` field requirement: must name the value collision (e.g. `"safety vs competitiveness"`) AND explain why both sides are defensible. |
| `lib/content-quality-gates.ts` | Added 5 new regexes and 4 new moral-only soft warnings: `abstract_policy_question`, `support_oppose_framing`, `undefined_collective_actor`, `undefined_action_verb`. All four suppressed when `EDITORIAL_TRADEOFF_MARKERS_RE` matches the question (explicit cost language like "even if", "anche se", "ma raddoppia", "più pericoloso", "which cost do you accept", "quale ingiustizia accetti"). Lifestyle (`dilemmaStyle === 'lifestyle'`) exempt by the same `if (!isLifestyle)` block as the existing depth warnings. |
| `tests/unit/content-quality-gates.test.ts` | Added 8 new cases: weak IT AI-regulation sample warns, weak EN AI-regulation sample warns, strong IT rewrite (`più pericoloso ... o ...`) does NOT warn, explicit-tradeoff IT policy dilemma (`ma raddoppia ... quale ingiustizia accetti`) does NOT warn, explicit-tradeoff EN policy dilemma (`which cost do you accept`) does NOT warn, clean concrete-actor moral dilemma does NOT warn, lifestyle stays exempt even with referendum surface tokens, warnings never block `passed=true`. |

### Verification

- `npm run typecheck` ✅ green
- `npm run build` ✅ green (all 41 static play/results routes prerender)
- `npx vitest run tests/unit/content-quality-gates.test.ts` ✅ 21/21 passing (was 13)
- `git diff --check` ✅ exit 0

### Hard constraints preserved

- No `AUTO_PUBLISH_DILEMMAS` behavior change. New checks are advisory only; `reasons` array is unchanged for all existing inputs; existing `passed=true` results stay `passed=true`.
- No Redis write, no Supabase migration, no auth change, no Stripe/webhook/entitlement change.
- No legal/cookie/analytics surface touched. No `LEGAL.md` update needed (no new data flows).
- No static-scenario rewrites in this sprint. Existing pool unchanged.
- No admin UI change; warnings surface via the same path used by `moral_option_bare_yes_no` and `magic_stipulation_in_question`.
- No `git push`, no deploy.

### Follow-up — `DYNAMIC-DILEMMA-EDITORIAL-WARNINGS-DRYRUN-01` (read-only audit, 25 May 2026)

Shipped same-day. Read-only `scripts/audit-editorial-warnings.mjs` ran the four editorial-shape regexes against the full production dynamic pool (346 approved + 53 drafts) via Upstash REST GET. Findings in `reports/dynamic-dilemma-editorial-warnings-dryrun-2026-05-25.md`.

- Approved moral-only flag rate: **34 / 324 = 10.5%**. Tradeoff-marker suppressor fired on 34 approved moral items (already protected).
- Draft moral-only flag rate: **10 / 53 = 18.9%**.
- Manual triage on top 30 flagged: strong-TP ~17%, TP/borderline-TP ~37%, FP/borderline-FP **~46%**.

Recommendation: **keep as advisory; do NOT escalate to hard rejection** until regex tuning + admin UI follow-ups land.

Two follow-up sprints queued (see also "SEO Sprint Queue" below — these are content-pipeline items, kept here):

#### Queued: `DILEMMA-EDITORIAL-WARNINGS-REGEX-TUNING-01`

Single-file edit on `lib/content-quality-gates.ts` + new vitest cases. Targets the two loudest FP families:

1. Expand `EDITORIAL_TRADEOFF_MARKERS_RE` with IT conditional verb forms ("ma penalizzerebbe / priverebbe / ridurrebbe / raddoppierebbe / danneggerebbe / costerebbe / sacrificherebbe / aumenterebbe / toglierebbe / escluderebbe") and the "rischiare" infinitive.
2. Tighten `SUPPORT_OPPOSE_RE` to require verb position (preceded by `should\s+\w+\s+`, `to\s+`, `dovrebbe(?:ro)?\s+`, `deve\s+`, or final-before-`?`) — eliminates noun matches like "the ban", "support forum", "approve" (medical), "limits".
3. Drop `gli altri` from `UNDEFINED_ACTOR_RE` OR add negative-lookbehind on `verso|agli|con|tra|degli` — eliminates personal usages.
4. Tighten `UNDEFINED_ACTION_RE` to verb position — eliminates noun forms like "limiti" (`limiti d'età`).
5. Re-run the dry-run; target FP ≤ 25%, TP ≥ 75% before considering hard-rejection escalation.

Safe / SEMI_AUTONOMOUS. Touches only the gate file + tests. No autopublish / Redis / legal / admin UI changes.

#### Queued: `ADMIN-UI-EDITORIAL-WARNING-SURFACE-01`

Admin review UI renders the four new warning codes with distinctive copy and the matched trigger token, so a human reviewer can verdict TP/FP per item in <5s. Out of scope for the regex-tuning sprint above. Touches admin UI only; no gate logic change.

#### Explicitly NOT scheduled

- Bulk retroactive rewrite of the 34 flagged approved dilemmas — too many are FPs. Hand-pick the strong-TP subset (5 items) only if a small editorial sprint is approved separately as `DILEMMA-EDITORIAL-REWRITE-FROM-DRYRUN-01`.
- Touching `lib/content-generation-prompts.ts` again. The 25 May SAFETY_RULES additions are fine; new generations should already be lower-noise.

### Residual risk / false-positive notes

- The four heuristic regexes are deliberately surface-only; they will produce false positives when a moral dilemma legitimately discusses policy without using an explicit tradeoff marker. Keep them as warnings (not reasons) until a dry-run against the live dynamic pool shows the signal is clean. The audit's recommendation (defer hard-rejection until dry-run) is preserved.
- `gli altri` (in "gli altri dovrebbero") is caught by `undefined_collective_actor` but not by `abstract_policy_question` (which requires a more specific noun like "i Paesi" / "la società"). Intentional: the broader `undefined_collective_actor` is what makes the warning fire on the canonical weak case.
- `EDITORIAL_TRADEOFF_MARKERS_RE` requires either a comparative-risk phrase ("più pericoloso", "more dangerous") or a cost-introducing connector followed by a real cost verb ("ma raddoppia", "but doubles"). Bare conjunctions like "ma" / "but" are intentionally NOT suppressors — they're too common in natural sentences to act as a tradeoff signal.
- Admin review UI does not yet surface the four new warning codes with distinctive copy; they display in the same generic "warnings" list as the depth warnings until a separate UI sprint is approved.

## 24 May 2026 — Home Declutter + Dilemma Quality Recovery

Five-phase sprint per `SPRINT: HOME-DECLUTTER-AND-DILEMMA-QUALITY-RECOVERY-01`. PM-reported "wall of cards" + shallow yes/no dilemmas blocking real product feedback.

### Shipped (5 commits, all on local `main`)

| Cluster | Commit | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| **Dilemma rewrites** | `2e266d9` | Apply depth-audit rewrites: 5 EN entries (lifeboat, revenge-vs-forgiveness, delete-social-media, ai-replaces-jobs, tax-billionaires) + 6 IT entries (same 5 + rich-or-fair PM-preferred phrasing). Same IDs, same categories. Natural Italian, no calques. |
| **Quality gate warnings** | `1f4f02e` | Add two non-blocking soft warnings to `runQualityGates`: `moral_option_bare_yes_no:option{A,B}` and `magic_stipulation_in_question`. Lifestyle exempt. SAFETY_RULES in `lib/content-generation-prompts.ts` extended with matching instructions. 13 new vitest cases (`tests/unit/content-quality-gates.test.ts`). Test count 109 → 122. No autopublish/save-mode changes. |
| **Card quietening** | `a616ba5` | DilemmaCard vote count now shown only at ≥50 votes (was `>0`). Badges already capped at one via single `badge` prop. |
| **Home structure** | `528bcb3` | EN home: drop Trending Now / Most Voted / Latest Questions / Browse All; add single 4-card "Pick your next" + compact CTA chip strip. IT home: drop Dilemmi in Evidenza / Di Tendenza / Nuove Domande / Tutti i dilemmi / Categorie / FAQ accordion; add single 4-card "Per te" + compact CTA chip strip with link to `/it/faq`. EN/IT structurally aligned. -146 LOC net. |
| **Docs** | (this commit) | ROADMAP, CURRENT_HANDOFF, disciplined-neon spec §10 "Home density discipline". |

### Verification

- `npm run typecheck` ✅ green
- `npm run build` ✅ green, all routes prerender
- `npm run test` ✅ 122 passing (was 109)
- `git diff --check` ✅ exit 0
- Local visual QA at 375 / 393 / 768 / 1024 px: pending PM smoke

### Hard constraints preserved

- No new analytics events; no `user_events` writes; no reveal-reaction tracking; no grace-undo tracking.
- No Supabase migration; no Redis write; no autopublish behavior change; no `AUTO_PUBLISH_DILEMMAS` change.
- `LEGAL.md` untouched (no data-flow / tracking / privacy change introduced).
- No `git push`, no deploy. All 5 commits await PM GO to push.

### Known follow-ups (separate sprints)

- **SEO**: `/it/faq` does not yet carry its own `FAQPage` JSON-LD. The IT home FAQ JSON-LD was removed because the visible accordion was removed. Tiny follow-up SEO sprint can move the schema to `/it/faq` page.
- **`BEHAVIORAL-INSIGHTS-DERIVATION-READONLY-01`**: queued by PM, not started. Live Supabase SELECT not approved by default — needs a separate GO and explicit data-source decision.
- Hard rejection vs. soft warning escalation on the new quality-gate patterns can land after a dry-run shows acceptable false-positive rate.

### Working state at this entry

- Local `main`: 5 commits ahead of `origin/main`.
- Dirty WIP: same 3 pre-existing Pixie tooling entries (untouched throughout the session).

## SEO Sprint Queue — Tactical Backlog

> Small, tactical SEO items queued for the next useful SEO sprint. Each item is independent — they can be bundled into one sprint or run separately. No new tracking, no DB writes, no new processors. PM GO still required before implementation per `CLAUDE.md`.
>
> Distinct from `## Future Backlog — SEO Goldmine & Governance` below: those are strategic initiatives needing their own scoping pass; the items here are tactical, edit-only, and ready to implement on PM GO.

### Quick wins added 24 May 2026

| # | Sprint | Effort | Why it's worth doing |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `SEO-BLOG-INTERNAL-LINKING-AUDIT-01` | 30–90 min | Cross-link related blog articles within the same cluster (loyalty / honesty, trolley variants, consequentialism vs deontology, etc.). Topical authority is a real Google signal. `lib/blog.ts` already exposes `relatedDilemmaIds` + `internalLinks` fields; the work is to audit current usage and insert anchor-text links between articles where natural. ROI alto, basso rischio. Effort range depends on number of blog articles. |
| 2 | `SEO-LLMS-TXT-BASE-01` | 15–20 min | Add `/llms.txt` per the Answer.ai 2024 proposed standard. Helps AI crawlers (ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, AI Overviews, Claude web fetch) understand which content to cite. **Adoption-driven bet — not yet a Google ranking factor.** Base version only: site map + brief platform description. Heavier `llms-full.txt` variant (concatenated body) is deferred until base shows traceable AI-citation traffic. |

### Already queued from 21 May 2026 GSC snapshot (still valid)

These three minor edit-only sprints were paused during the 22 May redesign and 24 May home declutter work. They remain valid and should ship the next time we touch SEO content. None overlap with each other; all touch existing blog pages only.

| # | Sprint | Locale | URL type | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | `SEO-IT-LEALTA-ONESTA-DIFFERENZE-FAQ-01` | IT | existing blog `lealta-vs-onesta-quando-le-due-virtu-non-possono-coesistere` | ~15 LOC, FAQ Q&A insertion |
| 4 | `SEO-LOYALTY-HONESTY-SNIPPET-TUNE-01` | EN | existing blog `loyalty-vs-honesty-when-they-collide` | ~5 LOC, meta + intro tune |
| 5 | `SEO-TROLLEY-FOOTBRIDGE-STATS-META-01` | EN | existing blog `trolley-problem-statistics` | ~2 LOC, meta description tune |

### Suggested bundling for the next SEO sprint

- **Bundle A — blog content batch**: #1 (internal linking) + #3 + #4 + #5. All blog-only, low coupling, one PM review pass. Estimated total 1–2.5 hours depending on blog article count.
- **Bundle B — llms.txt standalone**: #2 only. Creates a new `/llms.txt` route, independent of any other surface. Estimated 15–20 min. Can ship at any point before or after Bundle A.

**Priority within a single sprint**: Bundle A first (more validated SEO win), Bundle B after if time allows.

### Constraints (inherited across all items)

- No new analytics events; no `user_events` writes.
- No new processors / cookies / tracking.
- No content auto-publish.
- No sitemap / robots / `LEGAL.md` change unless the specific item explicitly needs it (none of the five should).
- EN/IT parity preserved where applicable.
- All items remain reversible — single-file or near-single-file edits.

## 22 May 2026 — End-of-Day Closeout

Today's session covered a Redis vote-count incident, a redesign batch, a copy/a11y polish pass, and roadmap bookkeeping. All work is pushed to `origin/main` (head: `16577b5`). Working tree has exactly three pre-existing Pixie WIP entries — no other dirty state.

### Shipped today (15 commits, all on `main`)

| Cluster | Commits | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| **Redis recovery** | `0509275`, `9aae7ba`, `145ca49` | Vote-count incident triage, reconstruction script (max-of-three-sources, never downgrade), execution log. See `reports/incidents/redis-vote-count-incident-2026-05-22.md`. |
| **Redis snapshot cron** | `4a65dd9`, `dd0a0ce` | Daily snapshot of `votes:*` to private Supabase Storage at 05:00 UTC. First manual run verified (`keyCount=136`, `totalVotes=219`, checksum recorded). Mitigation box ticked in DR runbook §8. |
| **Disciplined-neon redesign** | `83f970b`, `2bb30d2`, `12378d8`, `aafd477`, `5fa19d4`, `3881246`, `90df8c2` | Spec authored; home S1 applied; reveal hero amplified on results; DailyDilemma hero card strengthened; home copy reframed around self-positioning; purple/cyan ambient orbs removed site-wide; DESIGN.md updated to match. |
| **Copy + a11y polish** | `738035e`, `817fc34`, `f00415c` | IT daily-dilemma label naturalized (`scopri da che parte stai`); dilemma-card emoji aria-hidden + share tap target 44 px; first natural-Italian batch (personality teaser, expert insight, anon CTA, isolated minority, DailyDilemma CTA, vote-change copy). |
| **Tooling + content gate** | `e185f17`, `1d721a9` | Sharper dilemma-option generation gate; current-events draft inserter tracked (dry-run by default). |
| **Roadmap docs** | `16577b5` | Added SEO goldmine + governance as future backlog (this commit). |

### Working state

- Branch `main` aligned with `origin/main` at `16577b5`.
- Dirty WIP: exactly 3 pre-existing Pixie tooling files (`scripts/generate-pixie-assets.mjs` modified, `scripts/generate-pixie-emoji-assets.py` + `scripts/normalize-pixie-assets.py` untracked). Untouched throughout the session.

### Recommended next-session priorities

1. **`POST-SHIP-VISUAL-QA-FOLLOWUP-01`** — only if PM smoke at 375/393/768/1024 surfaces issues from today's home/DailyDilemma redesign or reveal hero amplification. Read-only otherwise.
2. **`PIXIE-TOOLING-FINAL-CLEANUP-01`** — decide what to do with the 3 dirty Pixie WIP files (commit them, delete them, or move to a long-running branch). Closes a working-tree noise source that's persisted across multiple sessions.
3. **`REDIS-SNAPSHOT-FIRST-SCHEDULED-RUN-CHECK-01`** — read-only post-05:00-UTC check that the first **scheduled** (not manual) snapshot landed. Confirms `votes/<date>.json` and `votes/latest.json` are dated within the most recent window. Just visual + dashboard inspection.
4. **`DILEMMA-CARD-VISUAL-AUDIT` follow-up** — only if PM finds card visuals still feel flat next to the redesigned DailyDilemma. Audit completed today recommended scope B (a11y polish only); scope C/D were explicitly deferred and remain available if PM later wants them.

### Items intentionally NOT scheduled

- `SEO-GOLDMINE-KEYWORD-AUDIT-01` and `SEO-GOVERNANCE-FOUNDATION-01` — recorded in the Future Backlog section above. Do not start either without a PM scoping sprint first.
- Full Upstash automatic backups — separate from today's app-level vote snapshot. Still TBD in `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md → Disaster Recovery & Backup`.
- EN copy voice polish — the audit identified low-severity EN candidates (`C13`, `C14`, `C17`, `C20` per `SITE-COPY-VOICE-AUDIT-EN-IT-01`). Deferred until after IT batch settles in production.

## Future Backlog — SEO Goldmine & Governance (not yet scheduled)

> Strategic SEO initiatives queued for future sprints. Not implementation-ready yet — each needs its own scoping pass + PM GO before code, agents, scripts, or cron get created. **No content auto-publish under any of these items** — HUMAN_ONLY per `CLAUDE.md`.

### 1. SEO-GOLDMINE-KEYWORD-AUDIT-01

**Status:** Backlog. Not scheduled.

**Mode:** Read-only. Generates a report; never writes to DB, Redis, sitemap, or content.

**Goal:** Identify high-opportunity keywords (EN + IT) that should drive new dilemmas, landing pages, blog articles, and internal-link insertions.

**Inputs:**
- Google Search Console exports / manual snapshots (PM-uploaded CSV — no API dependency in v1)
- Optional: internal `top_dilemmas` Redis read-only snapshot for category-demand cross-reference

**Outputs:**
- One ranked opportunity report per locale, saved under `reports/`
- Each opportunity maps to: (a) new dilemma candidates, (b) landing-page candidates, (c) blog-article candidates, (d) internal-link insertions
- Tagged by intent (informational / comparison / decision) and confidence (high / med / low based on impressions × position headroom)

**Hard rules:**
- No auto-publish, no draft creation, no DB / Redis writes
- No paid API dependency
- No SERP scraping
- Observed GSC data and LLM inference must be marked separately in the report

**Why deferred:** Needs data-source decision from PM + EN/IT clustering taxonomy spec before scripts exist.

### 2. SEO-GOVERNANCE-FOUNDATION-01

**Status:** Backlog. Not scheduled.

**Mode:** Docs / agents / scripts only at first. **No automation** until PM explicitly approves a recurring cadence in a separate sprint.

**Goal:** Codify the SAFE_AUTONOMOUS vs HUMAN_ONLY split for SEO tasks so future sprints inherit a stable governance frame instead of being re-litigated each time.

**Proposed deliverables (across multiple sub-sprints):**
- `SEO_GOVERNANCE.md` at repo root — daily / weekly review cadence, agent responsibilities, escalation rules. Lives as a sibling to `LEGAL.md` and `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md`.
- 2-3 specialist agent definitions in `.claude/agents/`: keyword prospector, internal-link auditor, meta / structured-data drift watcher. **All read-only**, matching the existing `.claude/agents/` convention.
- Optionally one `npm run seo:daily-report` command for read-only artifact generation. **Not** wired to cron in v1.

**Hard rules:**
- Reports-only automation first; cron / recurrence comes later only via a separately-named sprint
- No auto-publish; no draft creation; no save mode
- PM GO required for any content creation or publishing step
- All new agents must be read-only per `.claude/agents/` convention

**Why deferred:** Depends on the keyword audit being scoped first so the governance doc references real workflows, not speculative ones.

### Cross-cutting guardrails (apply to both items above)

- **Observed GSC data must be separated from LLM inference.** Reports must visually distinguish observed (GSC) data from inferred (LLM) opportunities. Never blend them in the same column.
- **EN and IT reports separate.** Each locale gets its own report; clustering and intent classifications differ (e.g. "dilemmi morali" vs "moral dilemmas" carry different SERP intent profiles).
- **No fragile SERP scraping in v1.** Brittle, ToS-risky, low-value vs a GSC-first approach.
- **No paid API dependency in v1.** No Ahrefs / Semrush / Moz until PM approves a budget item.
- **No sitemap / robots / legal changes** under either sprint without an explicit, separately-named sprint that touches only those files.

### Path to schedule

1. PM picks one of the two as the first sprint to scope properly. Recommendation: `SEO-GOLDMINE-KEYWORD-AUDIT-01` first — its output informs what the governance doc and agents should describe.
2. A scoping sprint (read-only audit) defines inputs, outputs, taxonomy.
3. Then an implementation sprint creates docs / scripts / agents — still no automation.
4. Only after the manual workflow is proven does cron / recurrence get a separate sprint.

## 21 May 2026 (afternoon update) — PM override: AdSense not a blocker; reveal loop prioritized

**PM directive**: AdSense review is **no longer a product freeze constraint**. Product development and launch iteration continue. Public changes ship when they improve the product and pass normal QA. AdSense-specific files (`<AdSlot>`, `public/ads.txt`, AdSense loader, Consent Mode v2 signals) still get extra care, but they are not a roadmap blocker. If AdSense rejects post-change, the site can be resubmitted later. The morning's freeze framing (see below) is **superseded**.

**PM product insight**: the SplitVote loop people respond to is not the vote — it's the **post-vote reveal**. Seeing whether you are in the majority, minority, near-even split, or against a landslide is the actual product hook: social comparison, self-positioning, identity interpretation. The architecture already supports this — the 6-state `revealState` enum and EN+IT copy strings live in `app/results/[id]/ResultsClientPage.tsx`, shipped 20 May (`8638c96` UX + `1384296` instrumentation). What's missing is **copy that lands the self-positioning moment harder**.

### Next candidates (post-PM override)

| # | Sprint | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | **`REVEAL-SELF-POSITIONING-COPY-01`** | **Top — implementation-ready** | Sharpen the 5 reveal desc strings (EN + IT parity) in `app/results/[id]/ResultsClientPage.tsx` (lines `:47-55` EN, `:125-133` IT) to lean harder into identity/self-positioning language. Copy-only, single file, ~20-30 LOC. Risk: low — same surface was tuned 8 days ago without regressions. |
| B | `DILEMMA-QUALITY-RUBRIC-01` | Draft sitting locally — awaiting PM review | `docs/dilemma-quality-rubric.md` drafted earlier today (250 LOC). 6-axis editorial framework (divisiveness, identity_relevance, moral_tension, ambiguity, curiosity_potential, emotional_weight). Internal-only, not an auto-publish gate. **Awaiting PM review** before commit. |
| C | `PIXIE-PIPELINE-VISUAL-QA-PREP-01` | Ready | Read-only audit of 72 Pixie PNG diffs species-by-species + contact-sheet report. Does NOT ship the PNG ship itself. ~45 min. |
| D | `SEO-IT-LEALTA-ONESTA-DIFFERENZE-FAQ-01` | Ready (unblocked by override) | IT FAQ Q&A on `lealta-vs-onesta` blog — see backlog table below. ~15 LOC. |
| E | `SEO-LOYALTY-HONESTY-SNIPPET-TUNE-01` | Ready (unblocked) | EN meta + intro tune. ~5 LOC. |
| F | `SEO-TROLLEY-FOOTBRIDGE-STATS-META-01` | Ready (unblocked) | EN meta tune. ~2 LOC. |

PM priority order (afternoon directive): **A first** (reveal-loop is the core product hook), then C/B in parallel as PM time allows, then SEO sprints in batch.

### SEO backlog (from 21 May 2026 GSC query snapshot, no longer freeze-gated)

22 impressions / 0 clicks across 9 queries; 7 of 9 cluster on loyalty/honesty/truth (EN + IT). Existing pages already cover the topics — gap is at the snippet/FAQ/meta layer. No new URLs proposed.

| # | Sprint | Locale | URL type | Target queries (imp) | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | `SEO-IT-LEALTA-ONESTA-DIFFERENZE-FAQ-01` | IT | existing blog `lealta-vs-onesta-quando-le-due-virtu-non-possono-coesistere` | `lealtà e onestà differenze` (1), `differenza tra onestà e lealtà` (1) | ~15 LOC, single file |
| B | `SEO-LOYALTY-HONESTY-SNIPPET-TUNE-01` | EN | existing blog `loyalty-vs-honesty-when-they-collide` | `loyalty and honesty` (3), `truth vs loyalty` (1), `honesty and loyalty` (1) | ~5 LOC |
| C | `SEO-TROLLEY-FOOTBRIDGE-STATS-META-01` | EN | existing blog `trolley-problem-statistics` | `trolley problem footbridge variant approval rate` (1) | ~2 LOC |

Brand queries (`split vote` 11 imp, `vote split` 2 imp, `split the vote` 1 imp = 14 total) need no action — brand discovery is healthy.

### Morning posture (superseded)

> **Note**: the morning entry below treated AdSense submission as a freeze constraint. **Superseded by the PM override above.** Kept for historical context only.

### Morning context (21 May 2026)

**AdSense review submitted** earlier today and is currently in progress. The morning posture treated this as a public-surface freeze; the afternoon PM override lifted that constraint.

**Internal ships today** (no public behavior change): repo hygiene + `.vercelignore` (`4d170b8`), content-generation clarity guard for admin/cron path (`09a454c`), Codex governance pointer (`c3945a9`), reports backfill (`6e08252`), PRODUCT_STRATEGY update for emotional recognition loop (`a7edae6`).

## 20 May 2026 — Emotional Recognition Loop + Retention Instrumentation ✅ DONE

Six commits shipped today completing Phase 1 + Phase 2 of the emotional recognition loop and adding retention-driver instrumentation.

**Deployed today:**

- `e185caa fix(analytics): remove GA4 first-party proxy to restore visitor geo` — GA4 now loads direct from `googletagmanager.com` (proxy was collapsing all visitor geo to Vercel edge IP — IT was 0% in GA4 while Vercel showed 59%). Commit was made late 19 May locally; pushed as the first deploy of 20 May.
- `8638c96 feat(results): sharpen post-vote reveal feedback` — Phase 1: shorter EN/IT reveal copy (tie/minority/majority/close/landslide), distinct TIE (symmetric red→purple→blue gradient) + LANDSLIDE (green→amber) visuals, bar fill animation 1000ms → 450ms, percentage opacity reveal 300ms, motion-reduce safe.
- `8f93c13 feat(routing): prefer same-category next dilemmas` — Phase 2.1: soft same-category preference in `getFreshNextScenarioId` (threshold ≥ 3 fresh same-cat items; backward-compatible signature). New `tests/unit/next-dilemma-affinity.test.ts` with 7 deterministic cases.
- `56dc73e fix(results): show sticky next after inline cta scrolls out` — `IntersectionObserver`-driven sticky bar: shows only when the inline Next CTA is off-screen. Graceful degradation when IO unavailable.
- `6e03d14 copy(home): clarify anonymous vote loop` — Home EN/IT hero + game-loop step 3 now say "Build your moral profile" / "Fai crescere il tuo profilo morale".
- `1384296 feat(analytics): add reveal state to results events` — Phase 2.5 instrumentation: enriched `result_viewed`, `next_dilemma_clicked`, `share_clicked` (results-page sites only) with `reveal_state` + conditional `reveal_pct_voted` (and `previous_*` on `next_dilemma_clicked`). **NO new event names.**

**Production smoke** (post-push for each): all curl-based markup checks green on `/results/trolley?voted=a|b` + `/it/results/trolley?voted=a`. Sticky markup + Phase 1 animation classes + motion-reduce variants + AdSlot gate (0 on trolley total=12) all confirmed.

**LEGAL.md**: trigger assessed for each commit — no new data processors, no new cookies, no new server-side persistence, no new consent surface, no new public-facing user-data categories. Privacy Policy and Terms unchanged. Internal LEGAL.md "Recent sprints" entry added for `REVEAL-STATE-INSTRUMENTATION-01`.

**Vercel performance**: no CPU warning today. Six pushes batched across the day (PM approved each individually after diff review). Yesterday's mitigations (sitemap ISR + API edge cache) remain in effect.

### Next candidates (tomorrow, priority order)

| # | Sprint | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `WIP-TRIAGE-AND-BRANCH-HYGIENE-01` | Ready (top) | PM-led triage of 77 M + 14 ?? files still in working tree (PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md, content-generation-*, content-quality-gates, ~70 Pixie PNGs, scripts WIP, untracked reports). Decide which to ship, merge, split, or discard. Pre-requisite for several downstream sprints. |
| B | `CONTENT-GENERATION-CLARITY-GUARD-SHIP-01` | Conditional on A | Ship the existing PM WIP on `lib/content-generation-*.ts` + `lib/content-quality-gates.ts` if it's complete and reviewed. Code-only, no DB / Redis. |
| C | `DILEMMA-QUALITY-RUBRIC-01` | Ready, independent | Docs-only spec for the dilemma quality scoring rubric (divisiveness, identity_relevance, moral_tension, ambiguity, curiosity_potential, emotional_weight) — drafted in the Phase 2 audit, formalize and commit. ~1 h. No code. |
| D | `PIXIE-ASSETS-WIP-AUDIT-01` | Ready, independent | Audit the ~70 PNG WIP in `public/pixie/**` — what's being updated, what's stale, what's intentional. Likely PM-led visual review; report-only. |
| E | `GA4-RETENTION-DIMENSIONS-QA-01` | Conditional on Vercel live + GA4 custom dimensions registered | Verify `reveal_state` / `reveal_pct_voted` / `previous_reveal_state` / `previous_reveal_pct_voted` arrive correctly in GA4 DebugView; build a single Exploration in GA4 to visualize reveal_state distribution over a 7-day rolling window. PM-side; no code. |

Removed from queue: `ADSENSE-REVIEW-READY-CHECKLIST-01` was already closed earlier; AdSense re-review submission remains HUMAN_ONLY pending PM action.

## 19 May 2026 (end of day) — AdSense remediation + Stripe QA + Vercel mitigation ✅ DONE

AdSense rejected the site again for "Contenuti di scarso valore". Full Phase 1 defensive remediation + Phase 2 substantive remediation shipped in the same day. Plus a side bugfix on results-page UX and CPU mitigations after a Vercel Fluid Active CPU warning.

**Deployed today:**
- `2776c4b perf(sitemap): hourly ISR revalidate to cut crawler CPU` — Vercel CPU mitigation #1.
- `db4d161 perf(api): cache aggregate results responses` — Vercel CPU mitigation #2 (15s edge cache + SWR).
- `d3b2d9b docs(adsense): audit low-value content risks` — read-only audit, root-cause analysis, Phase 1/2 plan.
- `87741d5 fix(adsense): suppress ads on thin review-risk surfaces` — Phase 1 gates: `<AdSlot>` only renders on play/results when `hasStaticInsight(id)`; results adds `total >= 50` gate; `/store` + `/it/store` noindex + sitemap removal; dynamic AI play/results noindex.
- `c88beaf fix(results): add vote CTA for unvoted dilemmas` — unrelated bugfix surfaced by PM during today's deploy: results pages had no path back to `/play/<id>` for unvoted users. Server now passes `hasVoted` to client; client renders "Vote on this dilemma →" card when neither `voted` (searchParam) nor `hasVoted` (cookie/Supabase) is set.
- `19a020b feat(content): add per-id insights for all static dilemmas` — Phase 2 substantive: insight coverage 5 → 41 static IDs (EN+IT, 328 substantive strings). Tests extended to enforce 41/41 coverage and forbidden-claim sweeps. The Phase 1 gate now opens for every static dilemma as soon as it crosses 50 votes.

**Production smoke** (post-deploy): all 7 checks passed — `/results/trolley`, `/it/results/trolley`, `/results/whistleblower`, `/it/results/whistleblower`, `/results/mercy-kill`, `/it/results/mercy-kill` all render per-id EN/IT insight bodies; sitemap holds 295 URLs (no `/store`); both store routes carry `robots: { index: false, follow: true }`.

**Stripe Premium QA** (separate docs-only closure today):
- `PREMIUM-STRIPE-LIVE-QA-01`: ✅ Checkout UI verified live by PM. Stripe Checkout opens on `splitvote.io/profile` and displays the Premium recurring monthly product correctly. The 29 Apr env-var fix is fully effective.
- ⏳ Live end-to-end payment (full webhook + entitlement cycle): not exercised this session. Residual risk small; not urgent.
- `STRIPE-STORE-COSMETICS-CHECKOUT-CONFIG-AUDIT-01`: closed as configuration-known/no-code. PM decision: defer Pixie/cosmetic one-time launch; keep all 14 Store products in graceful "coming soon" modal until business case justifies launch. Full code/migration/webhook is production-ready — only Stripe Products + 14 `STRIPE_PRICE_*` env vars remain unconfigured.

**Vercel performance**: 75% Fluid Active CPU warning received today. Mitigations `db4d161` + `2776c4b` deployed. Avoid nonessential deploys; batch future pushes. PM to recheck Vercel dashboard usage cycle in 24–48 h.

**LEGAL.md**: assessed for each commit — no new data processors, no new tracking, no new cookies, no new user data flows. The AdSense ad surface was *reduced*, not expanded. No public Privacy/Terms changes required. Logged in LEGAL.md "Recent sprints".

### Next candidates (tomorrow, priority order)

| # | Sprint | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `ADSENSE-REVIEW-READY-CHECKLIST-01` | Ready (top) | Read-only verification pass. Walks through `reports/adsense-low-value-remediation-audit-2026-05-19.md` "Do not request AdSense review until these are done" checklist; confirms each item is live in production; report green/red per line. Effort: ~1 h. |
| B | PM submits AdSense re-review | HUMAN_ONLY, conditional on A passing | After 24-48 h Googlebot recrawl window. PM action only — Claude cannot trigger AdSense from the dashboard. |
| C | `ABOUT-EDITORIAL-TRUST-ENRICHMENT-01` (or `EDITORIAL-POLICY-PAGE-01`) | Ready, conditional on AdSense re-review failing | If AdSense rejects again post-Phase-2, the next move is Phase 2 trust/E-E-A-T: enrich `/about` from ~300 to ~600-800 words, add `/editorial-policy` + `/methodology` pages (EN+IT), add `Person`-typed author byline on cornerstone blog posts. Estimated 4-6 h. |
| D | `GSC-EXPORT-CROSS-REFERENCE-01` | Blocked on PM | Unchanged — PM CSV export still pending. |
| E | `STRIPE-PREMIUM-LIVE-PAYMENT-01` | HUMAN_ONLY | One-off live €4.99 transaction (refundable from Stripe dashboard) to close the last open Stripe QA checkbox. Not urgent. |

Removed from queue: `PREMIUM-STRIPE-LIVE-QA-01` (checkout UI closed today; payment E2E split out as item E). `STRIPE-STORE-COSMETICS-CHECKOUT-CONFIG-AUDIT-01` (closed as configuration-known/no-code). `BLOG-INVALID-DILEMMA-ID-FIX-01` (audit was stale; `why-not-intervene` not in source — verified via `rg`).

## 19 May 2026 — IT topic landing parity audit ✅ DONE (no-op)

Phase 1 audit confirmed EN and IT topic landings already at perfect 1:1
reciprocal parity (11 EN + 11 IT in both `lib/seo-topics.ts` and the live
sitemap). The "19 EN / 12 IT" gap cited on 18 May was a counting artifact
in the GSC audit, not a real state — see Retraction 3 in
[reports/gsc-indexing-diagnosis-2026-05-18.md](reports/gsc-indexing-diagnosis-2026-05-18.md).

**Closed as no-op:**
- `IT-TOPIC-LANDING-PARITY-01` — zero missing IT landings; nothing to
  implement. Audit: [reports/it-topic-landing-parity-audit-2026-05-19.md](reports/it-topic-landing-parity-audit-2026-05-19.md).

**No runtime code touched.** Doc updates only:
`reports/it-topic-landing-parity-audit-2026-05-19.md` (new),
`reports/gsc-indexing-diagnosis-2026-05-18.md` (Errata Retraction 3),
`CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`, `ROADMAP.md`.

### Next candidates (post-19 May, priority order)

| # | Sprint | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `GSC-EXPORT-CROSS-REFERENCE-01` | Blocked on PM | Needs PM to export `Pages › Not indexed (Not found 404)` CSV from Search Console. Only path left for historical external 404s. |
| B | `BLOG-SEO-CONTENT-STRATEGY-01` | Ready (top unblocked) | Audit + update existing articles, plan cluster gaps + 2–3 new posts. Use `blog-seo-editor`. Report only, no auto-publish. |
| C | `PREMIUM-STRIPE-LIVE-QA-01` | HUMAN_ONLY | Manual live checkout QA on `price_1TQZuO6MLlYKqmclQm57kmvI` (€4.99/mo) if still pending per `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md`. Real card required. |
| D | `PIXIE-VISUAL-QA-POLISH-02` | Conditional | Only if PM visually finds a defect on /profile, /store, /dashboard, /u/[id], post-vote share. No queued issue today. |

Removed from queue: `IT-TOPIC-LANDING-PARITY-01` (closed as no-op).

## 18 May 2026 — SEO/Pixie/category closure day ✅ DONE

End-of-day status: SEO technical work closed; runtime code path stable.
Detail per-sprint, retractions, content inventory, and next-day priorities
are in [CURRENT_HANDOFF.md → Session 18 May](CURRENT_HANDOFF.md).

**Shipped (this week + today):**
- `SEO-TITLE-TEMPLATE-FIX-01` — removed duplicate `| SplitVote` suffix.
- `SEO-WORLD-WORDING-01` — copy/metadata aligned to "SplitVote voters".
- `IT-RESULTS-GRAMMAR-01` — IT grammar follow-up.
- `SITEMAP-I18N-CATEGORY-AUDIT-01` — EN+IT sitemap parity per category.
- `CATEGORY-HUBS-INTERNAL-LINKING-01` — category pages → discovery hubs.
- `CATEGORY-CONTENT-FAQ-PARITY-01` — lifestyle editorial + FAQ; 10 unit
  tests pass; 9 categories × 2 locales now have content parity.
- `RESULTS-PAGE-DEPTH-01` — dilemma insight sections on play + results.
- Pixie/store regression cluster (cosmetic ownership, equip flow,
  Nova/scintille mapping, Pixie selector, "no frame"/"no glow",
  per-species asset scaling).

**Closed as no-op:**
- `SEO-STALE-DYNAMIC-404-PROOF-01` — crawl of 22 source surfaces, 863
  unique `/play/*` and `/results/*` URLs, 863/863 = HTTP 200. Zero
  internal stale 404s. Mitigation sprint cancelled.
  Report: [reports/stale-dynamic-404-proof-2026-05-18.md](reports/stale-dynamic-404-proof-2026-05-18.md).

**Retracted (false positives from earlier audits, not regressions):**
- ~~`SEO-HREFLANG-BLOG-TOPICS-01`~~ — case-sensitive grep bug;
  296/296 URLs actually carry `hrefLang`.
- ~~`BLOG-INDEX-DEAD-LINK-AUDIT-01`~~ — auditor typo on slug; all 124
  internal blog links return 200.

**Content inventory verified live (18 May):** 41 static dilemmas, 779
dynamic approved in Redis, 0 dynamic drafts, 3 Redis blog published, 3
Redis blog drafts.

## 4 May 2026 — Lifestyle dilemmas + dataset import pipeline

**Obiettivo:** Aggiungere una categoria `lifestyle` per dilemmi giocosi (mare o montagna, estate o inverno, ecc.), pool di 40 seed topic per lingua, quality gate rilassate, e un endpoint di import diretto da dataset pubblici (ETHICS MIT, DailyDilemmas CC-BY-4.0).

**Shippato:**
- `lib/scenarios.ts` — aggiunto `'lifestyle'` alla union type `Category`
- `lib/dynamic-scenarios.ts` — campo `dilemmaStyle?: 'moral' | 'lifestyle'` su `DynamicScenario`
- `lib/content-generation-prompts.ts` — `buildLifestyleDilemmaPrompt()`: prompt giocoso, nessun framing morale, formato "X o Y?", category hardcoded a `lifestyle`
- `lib/content-quality-gates.ts` — `lifestyle` in `VALID_CATEGORIES`; `LIFESTYLE_AUTOPUBLISH_NOVELTY_THRESHOLD=10`, `LIFESTYLE_AUTOPUBLISH_FINALSCORE_THRESHOLD=30`; quality gate rilassate per lifestyle: question min 10 chars, option min 2 chars, language signal check saltato, similar items check saltato
- `lib/content-generation-validate.ts` — `lifestyle` in `VALID_CATEGORIES`
- `lib/expert-insights.ts` — fallback `lifestyle` EN/IT in `INSIGHTS`
- `app/api/admin/seed-draft-batch/route.ts` — param `style=lifestyle`; `LIFESTYLE_SEED_TOPICS` (40 per lingua); preflight e semantic review saltati per lifestyle; archetype check saltato; `dilemmaStyle` salvato sul scenario; `LIFESTYLE_NOVELTY_THRESHOLD=10`
- `app/api/admin/generate-draft/route.ts` — param `style=lifestyle`; routing al prompt lifestyle
- `app/api/admin/dataset-batch/route.ts` — nuovo endpoint bulk import senza AI; max 200 items/call; quality gate + novelty check (threshold=10); aggiornamento inventory intra-batch per dedup; attributable a dataset source; dataset consigliati: ETHICS (MIT), DailyDilemmas (CC-BY-4.0), Scruples (AllenAI)

**Come usare:**
- Generazione lifestyle: `POST /api/admin/seed-draft-batch` con `{ style: "lifestyle", locale: "it", count: 30 }`
- Import dataset: `POST /api/admin/dataset-batch` con `{ items: [...], dilemmaStyle: "moral" }`

---

## 4 May 2026 — Blog index pagination + IT translation fixes

**Obiettivo:** Ordinare gli articoli dal più recente al più vecchio, aggiungere paginazione responsive (9 per pagina desktop/tablet, 4 per pagina mobile), correggere frasi in inglese non tradotte negli articoli IT.

**Shippato:**
- `lib/blog.ts` — `getPostsByLocale` ora ordina per data discendente; fix "Would You Rather" → "Preferiresti" in 2 articoli IT (`domande-would-you-rather-difficili`, `dilemmi-morali-esempi`): title, seoTitle, tag, CTA labels
- `components/BlogGrid.tsx` — nuovo client component; paginazione viewport-aware (`ITEMS_DESKTOP=9`, `ITEMS_MOBILE=4`, breakpoint 768px); griglia `md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`; controlli prev/next EN/IT
- `app/blog/page.tsx` e `app/it/blog/page.tsx` — semplificati: usano `BlogGrid` invece del grid inline

---

## 4 May 2026 — Research Source Registry (internal foundation)

**Obiettivo:** Creare un registro TypeScript statico e versionato delle fonti autorevoli già usate nel trust layer, blog e landing pages. Foundation per futuri sprint di Content Intelligence, nuovi cluster SEO, e citazioni coerenti tra superfici.

**Shippato:**
- `lib/research-sources.ts` — nuovo file server-only (`import 'server-only'`); non importato da nessuna pagina pubblica in questo sprint
  - Tipi: `MoralCluster`, `SourceType`, `MoralAxisId` (locale, non accoppiato a `lib/personality.ts`), `ResearchSource`
  - Campi: `id`, `title`, `authors?`, `institution`, `url`, `type`, `openAccess`, `clusters`, `moralAxes`, `safeClaim`, `claimsToAvoid`, `citationStyle`, `requiresDisclaimer`, `contentOpportunities`, `addedAt`, `addedBy?`, `reviewedAt?`, `notes?`
  - `RESEARCH_SOURCES` — 10 fonti inserite (vedi tabella sotto)
  - Helper: `getResearchSourceById`, `getResearchSourcesByCluster`, `getResearchSourcesForLanding`

**Fonti inserite (10):**

| id | institution | clusters principali |
|---|---|---|
| `sep-moral-dilemmas` | SEP | trolley-problem, harm-prevention, deontology, loyalty-honesty |
| `sep-doing-allowing` | SEP | trolley-problem, harm-prevention |
| `moral-foundations-theory` | moralfoundations.org | moral-foundations, loyalty-honesty |
| `moral-machine-nature-2018` | MIT Media Lab / Nature | ai-ethics |
| `sep-privacy` | SEP | privacy, ai-ethics |
| `greene-moral-cognition` | Harvard University | experimental-moral-psychology |
| `sep-consequentialism` | SEP | consequentialism, trolley-problem |
| `sep-deontological-ethics` | SEP | deontology, trolley-problem, harm-prevention |
| `sep-experimental-moral-philosophy` | SEP | experimental-moral-psychology |
| `sep-virtue-ethics` | SEP | virtue-ethics |

**Note di framing applicate:**
- `safeClaim` in terza persona attributiva per tutte le fonti
- `claimsToAvoid` espliciti per prevenire overclaim su SplitVote
- `citationStyle: 'paraphrase-only'` per tutte le 10 fonti
- `requiresDisclaimer: true` su `moral-foundations-theory` e `greene-moral-cognition` (fonti spesso mal-parafrasate)
- `notes` su fonti fragili: `moralfoundations.org` (intermittente), `joshua-greene.net` (pagina personale)

**Non consumer-facing:** il file non è importato da nessuna pagina o componente in questo sprint. Content Intelligence admin MVP e integrazione nelle superfici pubbliche restano futuri.

**Verifiche:** typecheck ✅ — build ✅ — git diff --check ✅

## 4 May 2026 — Product explainer blog cluster EN/IT

**Obiettivo:** 4 articoli evergreen (EN + IT parity) che spiegano il prodotto senza marketing fluff. Goal: trust per AdSense review, ridurre thin-content risk, migliorare internal linking, dare valore ai nuovi utenti.

**Shippato:**
- `lib/blog.ts` — +4 EN posts + +4 IT posts (8 articoli totali); slug pairs con `alternateSlug` bidirezionale per hreflang automatico
  - `what-is-splitvote` / `cos-e-splitvote` — spiegazione prodotto, come funziona, per chi è
  - `how-anonymous-voting-works` / `come-funziona-il-voto-anonimo` — cookie locale, differenza senza/con account, aggregato ≠ identità, link a /privacy
  - `how-to-read-splitvote-results` / `come-leggere-i-risultati-splitvote` — cosa rappresenta la %, 50/50 vs 80/20, campione non rappresentativo
  - `what-your-moral-personality-means` / `cosa-significa-la-tua-personalita-morale` — 5 assi reali (Utility vs Principle, Freedom vs Safety, Loyalty vs Justice, Risk vs Caution, Individual vs Collective), 18 archetipi, framing entertainment

**Framing applicato:**
- Anonimato: "You can vote without creating an account" + "Anonymous votes use a local cookie" + "If you sign in, SplitVote can keep your vote history" — nessun claim assoluto su separazione identità
- Personalità: 5 assi da `lib/personality.ts` — nomi esatti, framing "inspired by moral psychology", non replica diretta di Moral Foundations Theory
- Risultati: "votes from SplitVote users, not a representative scientific sample" in ogni articolo risultati
- moralfoundations.org linkato solo nell'articolo personality, con framing prudente ("researchers who study moral foundations")
- Disclaimer obbligatorio in tutti gli 8 articoli

**Verifiche:** typecheck ✅ — build ✅ — git diff --check ✅

---

## 4 May 2026 — Research trust layer ✅ DONE

**Obiettivo:** aggiungere contesto accademico non prescrittivo su personality e topic landing pages per aumentare trust, ridurre thin-content risk AdSense, e migliorare SEO senza fare claim di validazione scientifica.

**Shippato:**
- `lib/seo-topics.ts` — +2 campi opzionali nel tipo `SeoTopic` (`researchNote`, `researchSources`); dati inline per tutti e 3 i topic pubblicati (trolley-problem, ai-ethics-dilemmas, loyalty-vs-honesty)
- `app/[topicSlug]/page.tsx` — blocco "Research background" condizionale (cyan, border-cyan-500/20) dopo la primary dilemma card; max 3 link autorizzati, disclaimer obbligatorio
- `app/personality/page.tsx` — blocco "Expert lens" tra "5 moral dimensions" e "18 archetypes"; 3 fonti EN; disclaimer
- `app/it/personality/page.tsx` — stessa struttura in IT ("Lettura esperta"); EN/IT parity

**Framing applicato:**
- Ogni nota usa "researchers study" / "philosophers explore" — nessun claim "SplitVote is validated by"
- Disclaimer fisso: "SplitVote is for entertainment and aggregate insight, not a scientific test." (IT: "...non come test scientifico.")
- Tutti i link con `target="_blank"` + `rel="noopener noreferrer"`

**Fonti usate:**
- `/trolley-problem`: Stanford Encyclopedia (Moral Dilemmas + Doing vs. Allowing Harm)
- `/ai-ethics-dilemmas`: Moral Machine / Nature 2018 + Stanford Encyclopedia (Privacy)
- `/loyalty-vs-honesty`: Moral Foundations Theory + Stanford Encyclopedia (Moral Dilemmas)
- `/personality` + `/it/personality`: Moral Foundations Theory + Stanford Encyclopedia (Experimental Moral Philosophy) + Joshua Greene / Harvard

**LEGAL.md**: nessun nuovo data processor, tracking, o claim legale — link statici a risorse terze. Nessun aggiornamento richiesto.

**Commit proposta:** `feat: add research-backed trust layer`

---

## 4 May 2026 — SEO/AdSense P2: personality SSR + internal links ✅ DONE (pending commit)

**Obiettivo:** ridurre thin-content risk per la revisione AdSense e rafforzare internal linking.

**Shippato:**
- `app/personality/page.tsx` — SSR intro block (H1, intro, 3-step how-it-works, 5 moral axes, 18-archetype grid emoji+name, CTA → /play/trolley + /trending, disclaimer) sopra `PersonalityClient`; fix hreflang `'it'` → `'it-IT'`
- `app/it/personality/page.tsx` — stesso SSR block in IT (nameIt, axesIt); CTA → /it/play/trolley + /it/trending
- `app/personality/PersonalityClient.tsx` — demote semantico `<h1>` → `<h2>` in tutti e tre gli stati (unlock, almost-there, profile); nessun cambio comportamentale
- `app/moral-dilemmas/page.tsx` — sezione play links (5 link diretti a scenari reali) + cross-links arricchito con /trending e /personality
- `app/would-you-rather-questions/page.tsx` — stesso trattamento EN
- `app/it/dilemmi-morali/page.tsx` — play links IT + cross-links con /it/trending e /it/personality
- `app/it/domande-would-you-rather/page.tsx` — play links IT + cross-links

**Commit proposta:** `fix: strengthen seo content for adsense readiness`

**Residui / next:**
- AdSense dashboard: creare ad units reali, impostare env vars su Vercel, fare redeploy, poi richiedere revisione AdSense

Legal/compliance tracker: `LEGAL.md`. Ogni sprint che tocca cookie, analytics, ads, auth/account data, pagamenti, AI content, email, geo feature o profili pubblici deve controllarlo e aggiornarlo se cambia il trattamento dati o la superficie legale.

Product strategy tracker: `PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md`. Usarlo per scegliere e delimitare sprint su premium/VIP, poll submission, personality sharing, bacheca pubblica, quest, cosmetici, micro-learning e community.

Claude Code guide: `CLAUDE.md`. Usarlo come guida operativa per ogni sprint; gli agenti specialistici vivono in `.claude/agents/`.

Design governance: `DESIGN.md` aggiunto (3 Maggio 2026) — token ufficiali, regole componenti, copy tone, vincoli accessibilità. Obbligatorio per ogni sprint UI/UX.

## Future Track — Mobile App Readiness

**Non è uno sprint attivo.** Web-first rimane la priorità. Queste fasi sono gate di readiness per un eventuale rilascio su app store.

**Decisione (28 Apr 2026):** nessuna app nativa ora. Un unico agente copre l'intero track: `.claude/agents/mobile-app-readiness-reviewer.md`.

| Fase | Stato | Gate richiesto |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 — Web mobile hardening | ⚠️ Parziale (landscape/portrait fix 28 Apr) | Prima di PWA |
| Phase 1 — PWA foundation | 🔲 Non iniziato | Phase 0 completo |
| Phase 2 — Store policy audit | 🔲 Non iniziato | Phase 1 + decisione iOS IAP |
| Phase 3 — Android wrapper (TWA/Capacitor) | 🔲 Non iniziato | Phase 2 completo |
| Phase 4 — iOS wrapper (Capacitor) | 🔲 Non iniziato | Phase 3 o decisione PM |

**Blockers critici prima di qualsiasi store submission:**
- ~~Account deletion in-app flow~~ — **✅ Implementato 1 Maggio 2026** (Danger zone in /profile → DELETE/ELIMINA confirmation → auth.admin.deleteUser cascade). Pending deploy + QA.
- Decisione iOS IAP vs Stripe web checkout (rischio policy Apple — vedi `PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md → Phase 2`)
- QA su dispositivi reali (non solo DevTools)

Agente da usare: `.claude/agents/mobile-app-readiness-reviewer.md`
Strategia dettagliata: `PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md → Mobile App Readiness`

### Started / Partially Implemented

- **Auth recovery** — Reset password flow implemented locally (pending deploy + QA): login → "Forgot password?" → email → `/reset-password` → update password. IT locale path via `?locale=it`. AuthButton locale fix (IT navbar "Unisciti →" links to `/login?locale=it`).
- **Social comparison layer** — Phase 1 (500ms reveal) shipped; analytics events + reconsideration prompt not started
- **AI generation at scale** — hardening shipped (cross-locale dedup, intra-batch visibility, rejectionReason, SEED_TOPICS cleanup, prompt guardrails); production dry-run QA pending; save mode gated by dry-run result; progress bar UX not started
- **Blog generation pipeline** — static articles done; Blog Draft Queue implemented locally (pending deploy + QA) — save/list/approve/reject in Redis, admin-only, approve ≠ publish live; generation quality audit not started
- **Stripe live QA** — config fixed, Preview QA done; end-to-end live payment not done

### Candidate Sprints

**PM priority order (updated 3 Maggio 2026):**

1. ~~**Vote reconsideration within window**~~ — ✅ **Client UX affordance shipped (3 Maggio 2026)**: opposite option is now a `<button>` with grace countdown when `canStillChange === true`; locked state unchanged; EN/IT copy parity. API already handled `can_change_until`; no API/schema changes. Residual: `canStillChange` reactivity in 60s tick; `vote_change` analytics event (LEGAL.md check required before adding).
2. ~~**Home/trending already-voted behavior**~~ — ✅ **P1 shipped (3 Maggio 2026)**: `VotedDilemmaCard` wrapper (cookie `sv_voted_{id}=`, badge + href swap, hydration-safe via `useState/useEffect`); game loop strip spostato sopra DailyDilemma; label "Today's dilemma — vote anonymously" / "Il dilemma di oggi — vota in anonimo"; subline hero copy sharpened EN/IT. EN/IT parity completa su home + trending. Residui: DailyDilemma voted-state polish (has "See results" link già presente — accettato); `/it/trending` empty state copy (D sprint).
3. **Core loop clarity + Pixie Phase 1** — game loop strip + hero copy parzialmente inclusi nel P1 (3 Maggio); Pixie rename (companion → Pixie, copy-only, zero DB) e "why answer" copy ancora pendenti. Full strategy: `PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md`.
4. **`/it/trending` empty state** — copy tecnico "Il cron genera..." → testo user-friendly italiano. Sprint D (bassa priorità immediata).
5. **AI generation re-QA** — after env update + redeploy; re-run 4 dry-run scenarios; gates save mode.

**Remaining (not reprioritized):**
6. ~~**Product explainer blog cluster EN/IT**~~ — ✅ **DONE 4 Maggio 2026**: 8 articoli (4 EN + 4 IT parity) in `lib/blog.ts`; cookie/privacy framing preciso; assi reali da `lib/personality.ts`; disclaimer in tutti; hreflang automatico via `alternateSlug`.
7. **Social comparison analytics events** — `result_revealed`, `user_in_majority`, `user_in_minority`, `near_even_split`; **requires LEGAL.md check**
7. **Reconsideration prompt** — "Would you still choose the same?" after reveal; never modifies vote; no DB change
8. **Generate 15 high-quality IT dilemmas** — blocked by save mode gate
9. **Blog SEO generation/review pipeline** — audit prompt/model, improve output quality
10. **Segmented result comparison** *(DEFERRED)* — locale-only first ("Chi vota in italiano"), deferred until enough IT traffic (≥ 500 votes on a popular dilemma); country/demographic segments require `LEGAL.md` review before implementation. Full spec in `PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md → Segmented Result Comparison Direction`.

### PM Priority Queue — Field Feedback 30 Apr 2026

Feedback from real viewers changed the near-term product priority. After Sprint 1 closes the delayed reveal/docs pending work, do not jump directly into heavier monetization or AI UX. First make the product easier to understand, share, and measure.

1. **Google Analytics audit (read-only)** — verify GA4/env/proxy/consent/events before judging product changes. No code fixes in the audit unless explicitly promoted to a separate sprint.
2. **Core loop clarity + Pixie Phase 1** — make it obvious that SplitVote is a social voting game: why answer, what happens after voting, what XP/streak/archetype/Pixie mean, and who the product is for. Include login icon clarity and Pixie rename (copy-only, no DB, no assets — full strategy in `PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md → Pixie Digital Avatar Direction`).
3. **Pre-vote question sharing** — standard share icon on home/play/dilemma cards; share the question with neutral copy before a user votes; keep selected vote private by default.
4. **Aggregate leaderboards MVP** — start with most-voted dilemmas/topics, then archetype distribution. Personal voter leaderboard comes later only with privacy controls and legal review.
5. **Macro-area paths** — curated paths for audiences such as parents, couples, work, technology, society, and young adults, using existing category/path mechanics before schema changes.
6. **Current-events dilemma workflow** — Italy/Europe/USA/World news-inspired dilemmas with source context, admin review, no autopublish, and legal/editorial guardrails.
7. **AI-assisted localization workflow** — use AI/tooling for draft translations only; public copy remains reviewed and committed. Do not add new locales until the core loop/share/analytics base is stable.
8. **SplitVote Content Intelligence Agent v1 + Picoclaw bridge** *(DEFERRED — docs updated 6 May 2026)* — Build the internal read-only gatekeeper before giving Picoclaw any structured ingestion path. Phase 0.5: SplitVote agent scans static/approved/draft inventory, seed usage, exclusions, duplicate clusters, and category gaps; outputs reports only. Picoclaw remains an external trend radar. No auto-publish, no auto-save, no automatic file mutation/commit/push/deploy. Full integration strategy in `PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md → Picoclaw + SplitVote Content Intelligence Direction`.
9. **Pixie Phase 2 — Base assets** — add Pixie Spark PNG stage 1–5 to `public/pixie/`; update `CompanionDisplay` with `<Image>` + emoji fallback; no DB. Prerequisite: assets generated and PM-approved.
10. **Pixie Phase 3 — Share card MVP** — shareable Pixie profile card (OG 1200×630 + story 1080×1920); `/api/pixie-card/[userId]` server-only endpoint; share CTA on dashboard. No DB migration. Prerequisite: Phase 2 assets. Privacy rules in `PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md → Pixie Shareability Direction`; confirm public fields in `LEGAL.md` before shipping.
11. **Pixie Phase 4 — Variant selector / earned variants** — variant picker UI; server-side unlock verification; `pixie_variant_equipped` column on `profiles`; earned criteria: Cloud (5 categories), Ember (7-day streak), Moonlight (mission streak), Champion (100 votes), Wisp (500 votes).
12. **Pixie personality + emotion system study** — define character traits, emotional expressions, and progression mood per Pixie before broad variant production. Use this as art direction for future Pixie sheets (idle, happy, proud, surprised, sad/low-energy, ultra legendary) and for richer level-up/share moments. No DB or monetization dependency; output should be a spec + approved reference sheet before implementation.
13. **Pixie Phase 5 — VIP cosmetics** — Premium variants accessible via entitlements; define cancellation behavior; verify `LEGAL.md` if Premium perk wording changes.
14. **Pixie Phase 6 — Purchased Pixies** — shop / bundles; `user_pixie_skins` table; Stripe Price IDs per variant. **Gate: `LEGAL.md` updated, Terms EN/IT digital goods section, Stripe QA complete, refund policy defined.**

### PM Field Observations — UX, Growth, Admin, AI Quality (30 Apr 2026)

Backlog of issues and ideas surfaced via direct product observation. None implemented yet. Full detail in `PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md → PM Field Observations`.

**P0 — Bugs (fix soon):**

- **Feedback counter bug** — dashboard/admin feedback counter appears broken; needs data-source audit before any analytics trust. Sprint: _Feedback analytics bugfix_.
- **AI seed draft network_error** — UI shows `network_error` after batch seed generation even when drafts save successfully; after refresh drafts appear. Likely timeout/client-response mismatch. Risk: may cause double generation if admin retries. Sprint: _Admin AI generation reliability_.

**P1 — Near-term UX/Growth:**

- **Mission deep links** — tapping an incomplete mission should navigate directly to the action needed to complete it (e.g., vote page for `vote_3`). Sprint: _Mission UX polish_.
- **Daily Dilemma full-card click** — the entire "Dilemma del Giorno" home card should be clickable; share CTA must not propagate the card click. Sprint: _Home interaction polish_.
- **Blog 2-column layout + share** — desktop/tablet blog should use 2 columns; share icon on card and article page (Web Share API + clipboard fallback). Sprint: _Blog growth polish_.

**P2 — Medium-term:**

- **Dashboard navigation IA** — profile, missions, rewards, and settings are too fragmented; restructure account navigation. Sprint: _Account UX restructure_.
- **Vote reconsideration via long press** — long-press on an already-chosen answer (within `can_change_until` window) triggers reconsider flow. High risk: touches vote flow, timing policy, mobile long-press, accidental changes. Sprint: _Vote reconsideration UX_.

**P3 — Longer-term / Gated:**

- **VIP display name colors** — premium cosmetic: palette of 10 named shades (Silver, Gold, Steel, Diamond, Ruby, Emerald, Sapphire, Amethyst, Neon Blue, Cosmic Purple) visible to other users and in admin/super-admin view. No gameplay advantage. Gate: entitlements review + Terms check if sold as Premium perk. Sprint: _VIP profile cosmetics_.
- **AI novelty + current-events engine** — improve draft generation to compare against published/approved/recent drafts, raise novelty threshold, reduce semantic duplicates. Current-events variant: news-inspired abstractions with no real names, no city specifics, no unverified claims, editorial review gate, no autopublish. Sprint: _AI content quality_ + _Current-events content engine_.

## Sprint completati — Micro SEO Hardening: title dedup + IT locale guard (3 Maggio 2026)

**Obiettivo**: due fix tecnici SEO a scope strettissimo lasciati dal programmatic SEO sprint. Zero runtime behavior change.

**Task A — Title duplicato** (`app/[topicSlug]/page.tsx`):
- Root layout `app/layout.tsx` ha `metadata.title.template = '%s | SplitVote'`
- `generateMetadata` passava `title = \`${topic.headline} | SplitVote\`` → Next.js produceva `"Headline | SplitVote | SplitVote"`
- Fix: `metadata.title = topic.headline` (template appende il brand una volta sola)
- `openGraph.title` e `twitter.title` usano `socialTitle = \`${topic.headline} | SplitVote\`` (campi OG/Twitter bypassano il template — suffix esplicito corretto)

**Task B — IT locale guard** (`lib/seo-topics.ts`):
- `getPublishedTopics()` e `getIndexableTopics()` non filtravano per locale → un futuro topic `locale: 'it'` sarebbe stato buildato in `app/[topicSlug]` (route EN-only) e incluso nella sitemap
- Fix: `&& t.locale === 'en'` aggiunto in entrambe le funzioni
- Nessun impatto sul build attuale: tutti e 3 i topic pubblicati sono `locale: 'en'`
- `getTopicBySlug()` invariato (sicuro: `dynamicParams = false` auto-404 gli slug non buildati)
- JSDoc su campo `locale` aggiornato: spiega che IT è schema-ready ma richiede route `/it/[topicSlug]` non ancora implementata

**Agenti**: seo-content-reviewer (SHIP) · release-readiness-reviewer (SHIP). frontend-ui-reviewer, backend-systems-reviewer, security-reviewer: non usati (no UI, no backend data, no auth).

**LEGAL.md**: nessun aggiornamento — solo metadata/build-time, zero runtime data/tracking.

**Verifiche**: typecheck ✅ · build ✅ (154 pagine statiche, 3 topic landing pages) · `git diff --check` ✅

**Title finale atteso**: `<title>The Trolley Problem — Would You Pull the Lever? | SplitVote</title>` (una volta)

**Residuo noto**: import `getIndexableTopics` in `app/[topicSlug]/page.tsx` è pre-esistente dead import (il file calcola `isIndexable` inline) — out of scope, non causa errori.

---

## Sprint completati — P1 Already-Voted UX + Core Loop Clarity (3 Maggio 2026)

**Obiettivo**: client-side detection dei voti già espressi su home/trending, badge + redirect verso results, chiarezza visiva del game loop.

**Modifiche**:
- `components/DilemmaCard.tsx`: aggiunto `'voted'` al tipo `DilemmaCardBadge`; badge `✓ Voted` / `✓ Votato` in `bg-green-500/20 text-green-400 border border-green-500/30`
- `components/VotedDilemmaCard.tsx` (nuovo): client component, `useState(false)` + `useEffect` che legge `document.cookie.includes(\`sv_voted_${scenario.id}=\`)` dopo hydration; swappa badge → `'voted'` e href → `resultsHref` se già votato; server render sempre nello stato non-votato (idration-safe su ISR)
- `app/page.tsx`: import VotedDilemmaCard; subline aggiornata; game loop strip e trust strip spostati sopra DailyDilemma; label "Today's dilemma — vote anonymously" aggiunto; sezioni Trending Now / Most Voted / Latest Questions usano VotedDilemmaCard con `locale="en"`
- `app/it/page.tsx`: stesse modifiche in IT; label "Il dilemma di oggi — vota in anonimo"; sezioni IT con `locale="it"` e href `/it/results/${id}`
- `app/trending/page.tsx`: sezione "Trending Today" sostituisce i `<Link>` custom con griglia 2-col VotedDilemmaCard; import `Category` aggiunto per correggere tipo `DisplayItem.category: string → Category`
- `app/it/trending/page.tsx`: sezione "Tendenze Oggi" (hasItDynamic=true path) con VotedDilemmaCard 2-col

**Agenti**: product-growth-reviewer (no blockers) · frontend-ui-reviewer (`locale="en"` polish applicato) · release-readiness-reviewer (SHIP).

**LEGAL.md**: no update — cookie `sv_voted_*` già documentato in Privacy Policy; nessun nuovo dato raccolto; read-only client cookie già esistente.

**Verifiche**: typecheck ✅ · build ✅ (154 pagine) · `git diff --check` ✅

**Residui accettati**:
- DailyDilemma voted-state: ha già "See results" link + play page redirecta su cookie; wrapping non triviale; deferred
- `/it/trending` empty state copy tecnica ("Il cron genera..."): deferred a sprint D separato

---

## Sprint completati — Docs: Agent Governance + DESIGN.md (3 Maggio 2026)

**Obiettivo**: aggiungere infrastruttura di governance per sprint UI/UX e backend senza toccare codice runtime.

**Modifiche**:
- `.claude/agents/frontend-ui-reviewer.md` (nuovo): agente tecnico React/Tailwind/a11y/mobile — design token compliance, aria, touch targets, EN/IT overflow, hydration safety, loading/error/empty states
- `.claude/agents/backend-systems-reviewer.md` (nuovo): agente data correctness — vote integrity, Redis atomicity, Supabase, API response shape, caching strategy, cron idempotency, graceful degradation
- `CLAUDE.md`: sezione Specialist Agents aggiornata con i due nuovi agenti + Agent Pairing Rules (UI/UX sprints: product-growth + frontend-ui + release-readiness; API/data sprints: backend-systems + security (se auth) + release-readiness)
- `DESIGN.md` (nuovo): token ufficiali, regole componenti, copy tone, vincoli accessibilità, hydration safety rules — obbligatorio per ogni sprint UI/UX

**LEGAL.md**: nessun aggiornamento — solo documentazione interna, zero runtime.

**Verifiche**: typecheck ✅ · build ✅ · `git diff --check` ✅

---

## Sprint completati — Role Management MVP (29 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: sostituire il modello `ADMIN_EMAILS` flat con ruoli DB espliciti (Phase 1). Zero lockout: dual-check durante la migrazione.

**Modifiche**:
- `supabase/migration_v15_role_management.sql`: colonna `role` su `profiles` (CHECK constraint, default 'user'), tabella `role_audit_log` (RLS no-client), trigger BEFORE UPDATE anti-escalation, bootstrap mat.pizzi → super_admin e genghi77 → admin
- `lib/admin-auth.ts`: aggiunto `UserRole`, `ROLE_HIERARCHY`, `isRoleAtLeast()`, `ASSIGNABLE_ROLES`
- `lib/entitlements.ts`: `UserEntitlements` estesa con `isSuperAdmin`, `role`, `canManageRoles`; dual-check in `getUserEntitlements()` (ADMIN_EMAILS fallback temporaneo Phase 1 + DB role)
- `app/api/me/entitlements/route.ts`: fetch `role` da profiles, passa a `getUserEntitlements()`
- `lib/admin-guard.ts` (nuovo): helper centrale `requireAdmin()` — dual-check ADMIN_EMAILS fallback + DB role; tutti gli endpoint admin lo usano
- `app/api/admin/roles/route.ts` (nuovo): GET lista utenti privilegiati (super_admin only)
- `app/api/admin/roles/assign/route.ts` (nuovo): POST assegna role (super_admin only, audit non best-effort: warning in risposta se fallisce, blocca assegnazione di super_admin via API)
- `app/admin/RolesPanel.tsx` (nuovo): client component per la gestione ruoli (mostra audit warning se presente)
- `app/admin/page.tsx`: gate usa `canAccessAdmin` (dual-check); fetch DB role prima del gate; tab "Roles" visibile solo a super_admin
- Tutti gli 11 endpoint `app/api/admin/**` aggiornati: `isAdminEmail` sostituito con `requireAdmin()` — accettano DB role admin/super_admin oltre ad ADMIN_EMAILS
- `LEGAL.md`: sprint trigger "security controls / admin access" documentato
- `ROADMAP.md`: aggiornato

**Verifiche**: typecheck ✅ build ✅ diff --check ✅

**Note architetturali — Phase 1**:
- `ADMIN_EMAILS` resta attivo come fallback: `isAdmin = isAdminEmail(email) OR isRoleAtLeast(role, 'admin')`. È il safety net contro lockout se il bootstrap DB fallisce.
- `isSuperAdmin` è esclusivamente DB-derivato: nessuna email può dare super_admin senza il DB role.
- `components/AuthButton.tsx` mostra il link admin solo se `isAdminEmail` — un admin DB-only senza email in ADMIN_EMAILS vede il pannello navigando direttamente, ma non vede il link nav. Da gestire in Phase 2.

**Residui (Phase 2)**:
- Rimozione di `ADMIN_EMAILS` dalla logica isAdmin (dopo bootstrap verificato in prod)
- Aggiornamento `AuthButton.tsx` per usare DB role via `/api/me/entitlements`
- Badge visivo super_admin su profilo pubblico (sprint separato)

---

## Sprint completati — Blog SEO: Article JSON-LD + Twitter card + Category editorial content (29 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: tre miglioramenti SEO tecnici su blog e category pages. Zero runtime behavior change, zero data/user tracking change.

**Modifiche**:
- `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` + `app/it/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`: aggiunto `schema.org/Article` JSON-LD (headline, description, datePublished, inLanguage, publisher) e `twitter:card summary` con site/creator tag
- `app/blog/page.tsx` + `app/it/blog/page.tsx`: aggiunto `export const revalidate = 86400` (blog statico, nessun motivo di rigenerare ogni request)
- `app/category/[category]/page.tsx` + `app/it/category/[category]/page.tsx`: aggiunta sezione editoriale (heading + editorial paragraph + 3 FAQ collassabili) importata da `lib/categoryContent.ts`
- `lib/categoryContent.ts` (nuovo): mappa 8 categorie × 2 lingue → `{ editorial, faqHeading, faq[] }`. Copy revisionato: rimossi claim su "SplitVote global data", rimossi "most research suggests", rimosso claim neurologico su social rejection senza fonte

**LEGAL.md**: nessun aggiornamento — nessun cambio a dati, tracking, cookies, auth, payments, user behavior.

**Verifiche**: `npm run typecheck` ✅ · `npm run build` ✅ · `git diff --check` ✅

---

## Sprint completati — Stripe Production Env Fix: `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PREMIUM` corretta (29 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: documentare la correzione manuale della env var `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PREMIUM` in Vercel Production che impediva il funzionamento del checkout Premium. Nessuna modifica al codice runtime.

**Root cause reale (confermata 29 Apr 2026)**: `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PREMIUM` in Vercel Production conteneva per errore una Stripe Secret Key (`sk_live_...`) invece di un Price ID. Il codice usa `mode: 'subscription'` con `line_items: [{ price: STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PREMIUM }]` — Stripe rifiutava la chiamata perché il valore passato non era un Price ID valido. La narrativa precedente "prezzo one-time vs ricorrente" era imprecisa; la root cause era l'env var errata.

**Fix manuale (Matteo, 29 Apr 2026)**:
- `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PREMIUM` in Vercel → Environment Variables → scope Production aggiornata con il Price ID corretto del prodotto SplitVote Premium (recurring monthly, €4.99/mese)
- Vercel Production redeployata con successo
- Nessuna modifica al codice runtime

**Stato post-fix**:
- ✅ Env var corretta, Vercel Production redeployata
- ✅ Codice già corretto (`mode: 'subscription'`, price via env) — nessuna modifica necessaria
- ✅ Webhook lifecycle, idempotency, entitlements: verificati su Preview 28 Apr (invariati)
- [ ] Checkout UI su `splitvote.io/profile`: da verificare manualmente — aprire checkout, confermare che mostri piano ricorrente mensile
- [ ] Pagamento live end-to-end: non ancora eseguito

**Nessuna modifica a**: codice runtime, Stripe webhook, Supabase schema, Redis, vote flow, i18n.

---

## Sprint completati — Stripe Preview QA: backend/webhook/entitlements verified (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: eseguire il QA Stripe su Vercel Preview con test mode. Nessuna modifica al codice runtime.

**Preview**: branch `stripe-preview-qa` — `splitvote-git-stripe-preview-qa-matpizzi-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app`

**Risultati verificati**:
- ✅ `POST /api/stripe/subscription` → Checkout Session test generata correttamente
- ✅ Webhook `checkout.session.completed` ricevuto e processato → `is_premium=true`, `stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_subscription_id`, `subscription_status='active'`
- ✅ `GET /api/me/entitlements` post-attivazione → `effectivePremium=true`, `noAds=true`, `canSubmitPoll=true`
- ✅ Billing Portal → apre correttamente
- ✅ Cancellazione via Stripe CLI → `customer.subscription.deleted` processato → `is_premium=false`, entitlements revocati
- ✅ Webhook idempotency end-to-end → duplicate resend non riattiva Premium

**Limitazione**: submit finale hosted Checkout non completato via browser automatizzato (Stripe anti-automation sull'UI) — richiede verifica manuale umana con carta `4242`.

**Blocker produzione identificato e risolto (29 Apr 2026)**: `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PREMIUM` in Vercel Production conteneva per errore una Stripe Secret Key invece di un Price ID — corretta il 29 Apr con il Price ID del prodotto SplitVote Premium (recurring monthly, €4.99/mese). Vedi sprint "Stripe Production Env Fix" sopra.

**Nessuna modifica a**: codice runtime, Stripe env production, Supabase schema, Redis, vote flow.

---

## Sprint completati — Expert Insight V2: copy + UX results page (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: migliorare gli Expert Insights post-voto per aumentare retention, interesse e sharability. Zero AI runtime, zero DB, zero nuovi servizi.

**Modifiche**:
- `lib/expert-insights.ts`: riscrittura completa del copy per tutte le 8 categorie (morality, justice, relationships, technology, society, freedom, survival, loyalty). Body più pungente e narrativo; whyPeopleSplit più specifico con meccanismo psicologico/sociologico; whatYourAnswerMaySuggest meno hedged e più concreto. EN e IT entrambi riscritti come testo nativo, non come traduzione.
- `app/results/[id]/ResultsClientPage.tsx`: Expert Insight spostato prima del Primary Share CTA (era dopo). Utenti leggono l'insight contestualmente ai risultati, aumentando motivazione a condividere. Sezione-label "Why people split" / "Perché le persone si dividono" resa leggermente più visibile (`text-[11px]` + opacity più alta). Nessuna modifica strutturale ai dati, al vote flow, ai cookie, all'anonimato o alle share card.

**Anonimato share**: invariato. Tutte le share card e caption usano dati aggregati (`pctA%/pctB%`, maggioranza) — mai il voto personale dell'utente.

**LEGAL.md**: nessuna modifica — nessun nuovo dato raccolto, nessuna variazione nel trattamento dati, share content rimane aggregate-only.

**Categorie migliorate**: morality, justice, relationships, technology, society, freedom, survival, loyalty (tutte e 8).

---

## Sprint completati — Stripe QA Docs: Live Mode Warning + Preview Test Runbook (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: aggiornare documentazione Stripe QA dopo aver verificato che la produzione usa `sk_live_...`. Aggiunto warning esplicito nel runbook. Aggiunto percorso QA raccomandato su Vercel Preview con test mode. Nessuna modifica al codice runtime.

**Contesto**: production `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...` — carte test (`4242...`) non funzionano in live mode. Il QA manuale con carta test deve avvenire su Vercel Preview con env vars test.

**Modifiche docs**:
- `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md` sezione "Stripe QA End-to-End": aggiunto warning prominente "PRODUZIONE IN LIVE MODE"; aggiunto runbook step-by-step per Vercel Preview (Step 1-7: test mode, price IDs test, env Preview, webhook endpoint test, redeploy); separato percorso Preview (principale) da percorso localhost CLI (alternativo); aggiornata checklist stato.
- `ROADMAP.md`: aggiornato stato sprint.
- `LEGAL.md`: aggiunta nota nel tracker "Recent sprints" — QA pagamenti non eseguito, richiede Preview test env prima di attivare Premium a pagamento su utenti reali.

**Stato Stripe QA (aggiornato)**:
- ✅ Audit statico completo: webhook lifecycle, idempotency, AdSlot, entitlements, log safety
- ✅ Bug fix: try/catch su chiamate Stripe API (checkout, subscription, portal)
- ✅ QA Vercel Preview eseguito (28 Apr 2026) — backend/webhook/entitlements verified — vedi sprint "Stripe Preview QA" sopra
- ✅ Blocker produzione risolto (29 Apr 2026): `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PREMIUM` in Vercel Production conteneva per errore una Stripe Secret Key invece di un Price ID — corretta il 29 Apr con il Price ID del prodotto SplitVote Premium (recurring monthly, €4.99/mese). QA checkout live ancora pending.

**Nessuna modifica a**: codice runtime, Stripe env in produzione, pricing, Supabase schema, Redis, vote flow, analytics, i18n.

## Sprint completati — Full IT Profile Audit + Mobile Landscape Responsive (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: completare localizzazione IT del profilo/account (demografici, membership, stats, messaggi); migliorare layout su mobile landscape (844×390) e tablet; aggiungere script QA per stringhe hardcoded.

**Stringhe IT corrette in `app/profile/ProfileClient.tsx`** (audit completo):
- Demografici: `Used only in aggregate…` → `Usati solo in forma aggregata…`; `Birth Year` → `Anno di nascita`; `Gender` → `Genere`; opzioni genere (Maschio/Femmina/Non binario/Preferisco non dirlo); `Country` → `Paese`; `Select country` → `Seleziona paese`; nomi paesi con `nameIT` per tutti i 20 paesi (Italia, Stati Uniti, Regno Unito, ecc.)
- Stats: `Dilemmas voted` → `Dilemmi votati`; `Badges earned` → `Badge ottenuti`; `Day streak 🔥` → `Giorni di serie 🔥`; `Member since` → `Iscritto da`; formato data `'en-GB'` → `'it-IT'` per IT
- Membership: `Upgrade to Premium` → `Passa a Premium`; `Unlock all SplitVote features` → `Sblocca tutte le funzioni SplitVote`; feature list IT; `Manage Billing` → `Gestisci Abbonamento`; `Opening…` → `Apertura…`; admin description; tutte le 4 feature bullets
- Identità: `Display Name` → `Nome visualizzato`; `Your display name` → `Il tuo nome`; `🔒 More avatars unlock…` → `🔒 Altri avatar si sbloccano…`; `Your public profile` → `Il tuo profilo pubblico`; messaggio rename a pagamento
- Trophy case: `Your public profile shows all trophies →` → localizzato; `preview` → `anteprima`
- Messaggi success/error da URL params e funzioni save/checkout: tutti localizzati
- `renameLabel()`: labels `Unlimited (Admin/Premium)`, `First change free` → localizzati

**Responsive (mobile landscape + tablet)**:
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` stats grid: `grid-cols-4` → `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4` — migliora portrait (2×2) senza rompere landscape (4 colonne a 640px+)
- `app/profile/ProfileClient.tsx` premium feature list: `ul` flat → `grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-y-1.5 gap-x-4` — 2 colonne a landscape/tablet
- Verificato: breakpoint `sm:` (640px) copre landscape 844px, `md:` (768px) copre tablet portrait. Nessuna dipendenza da orientation hack.

**Script QA**:
- `scripts/check-it-copy.mjs` — grep mirato su ProfileClient, DailyMissions, CompanionDisplay, PersonalityClient per stringhe EN hardcoded fuori da ternario `IT ?`; exit 1 se trova violazioni; aggiunto `npm run check:it-copy`

**Nessuna modifica a**: vote flow, Supabase schema, Redis, Stripe, analytics, middleware, lib/missions.ts.

---

## Sprint completati — XP Refresh + Moral Profile IT + Companion/Missions i18n + Role Model Docs (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: fix XP bar che non si aggiornava dopo claim missione; fix Moral Profile in inglese su sito/account italiano; localizzazione Companion e Missioni; documentazione role model futuro.

**Bug root cause — XP bar statica dopo claim**: `DailyMissions` usava la prop `xp` direttamente in `getLevelInfo(xp)` senza stato locale. Dopo un claim la prop era statica (il server component non veniva re-renderizzato automaticamente). Fix: aggiunto stato locale `currentXp` inizializzato dalla prop; dopo ogni claim con successo si legge `xpAwarded` dalla response API e si aggiorna `currentXp += xpAwarded`. Aggiunto `router.refresh()` per aggiornare anche il server component `CompanionDisplay` (XP Totale) e le stats del dashboard.

**Bug root cause — Moral Profile in inglese**: `/personality` (route EN) non leggeva il cookie `lang-pref` e passava sempre `locale="en"` a `PersonalityClient`. Inoltre i link verso `/personality` nel dashboard e nel profilo non rispettavano la locale. Fix: `app/personality/page.tsx` ora legge il cookie `lang-pref` server-side e passa la locale corretta; dashboard e ProfileClient puntano a `/it/personality` quando IT.

**Fix applicati**:
- [x] `components/DailyMissions.tsx` — aggiunto prop `locale?: string`; stato locale `currentXp`; `useRouter` + `router.refresh()` dopo claim; `xpAwarded` letto dalla response; copy IT per header, streak, missioni complete, errori; mappa `IT_MISSION_TITLES` per i titoli missioni in italiano.
- [x] `components/CompanionDisplay.tsx` — aggiunto prop `locale?: string`; `IT_STAGE_LABELS` (Cucciolo/Apprendista/Esploratore/Campione/Leggendario); copy IT per "Il tuo Compagno", voti, stadio, XP Totale, missioni, forma leggendaria; fallback EN invariato.
- [x] `app/dashboard/page.tsx` — `locale={locale}` passato a `CompanionDisplay` e `DailyMissions`; link personalità corretto: `IT ? '/it/personality' : '/personality'`.
- [x] `app/personality/page.tsx` — aggiunto `import { cookies } from 'next/headers'`; `locale` letto dal cookie `lang-pref` server-side; `PersonalityClient` riceve `locale` corretto anche su `/personality` con utente IT.
- [x] `app/profile/ProfileClient.tsx` — link "View personality" cambiato a `IT ? '/it/personality' : '/personality'`; label "Vedi" in IT. **QA fix (5322f04)**: 4 stringhe hardcoded inglesi nella sezione personality ("Your archetype is ready", "Discover your moral profile...", "Discover your moral archetype", "{n} / 3 votes — keep voting...") ora rispettano `IT`.
- [x] `PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md` — sezione "Future Role Model" aggiunta: definizioni Super Admin / Admin / Moderator / Creator; prerequisiti implementazione (audit log, DB/RLS review, legal trigger).
- [x] `ROADMAP.md` — timestamp aggiornato; sprint entry aggiunto.

**Nessuna modifica a**: vote flow, Supabase queries, API routes, middleware, Stripe, Redis, `lib/missions.ts`, mission validation logic, XP reward values.

**Cosa resta in inglese** (fuori scope di questo sprint):
- Level titles nel XP bar ("New Voter", "Debater", etc.) — definiti in `lib/missions.ts`; sprint dedicato necessario
- Rarity labels del companion ("common", "rare", etc.) — dati tecnici interni
- Status badges admin ("Pending review", "Live", "Rejected") — stabilmente brevi

**Check manuale richiesto post-deploy**:
- Dashboard IT: riscattare una missione → barra XP si aggiorna immediatamente senza reload
- Companion "XP Totale" aggiornato dopo reload (router.refresh)
- Secondo claim della stessa missione: non aggiunge XP (idempotent, `xpAwarded: 0`)
- `/it/personality` completamente in italiano (assi, archetipo, bottoni)
- `/personality` con cookie `lang-pref=it`: risponde in italiano
- `/personality` senza cookie: risponde in inglese
- Dashboard IT → click personalità → porta a `/it/personality`
- Profile IT → click "Vedi" personalità → porta a `/it/personality`

## Sprint completati — AdminCharts Mobile Fix + i18n Account Surfaces (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: correggere grafici non visibili su mobile nel tab Voting dell'admin; migliorare copy italiano su dashboard, profilo e admin.

**Bug root cause — grafici vuoti su mobile**: I componenti `VotesChart` e `SignupsChart` usavano `style={{ height: '${pct}%' }}` su un elemento figlio di un flex container senza altezza esplicita. I flex item (`flex-1`) nel parent `flex items-end h-32` non avevano `h-full`, quindi la percentuale non aveva un valore di riferimento e il browser calcolava la barra come 0px su mobile.

**Fix applicati**:
- [x] `app/admin/AdminCharts.tsx` — refactor struttura colonne: rimossa `items-end` dal wrapper, ogni colonna è `h-full flex flex-col`, area chart interna è `flex-1 flex-col justify-end relative` → le barre ora hanno parent height definita e `height: X%` funziona correttamente. Hover count spostato ad `absolute top-0`. Minima altezza barra: 3% per valori > 0, 0px per zero-count. Aggiunto summary testuale totale sotto ogni chart.
- [x] `app/admin/AdminCharts.tsx` — aggiunto prop `locale?: string`; titoli chart localizzati (IT: "Voti al giorno", "Iscrizioni al giorno"); empty state e summary IT.
- [x] `app/admin/page.tsx` — `cookies()` server-side per leggere `lang-pref`; TABS array localizzato (IT: Panoramica/Voti/Contenuti/QA contenuti/Bozze AI/Blog/Monetizzazione); "Top voters" → "Utenti più attivi" e "Recent signups" → "Nuove iscrizioni" in IT; `locale` passato a VotesChart e SignupsChart.
- [x] `app/dashboard/page.tsx` — `cookies()` per locale; saluto IT (`Ciao`), personalità morale, Premium Attivo/Piano Gratuito/Gestisci/Upgrade, stats grid (Voti/XP/Streak/Badge), Streak Milestones, cronologia voti, domande inviate.
- [x] `app/profile/page.tsx` — `cookies()` per locale, passato a `ProfileClient`.
- [x] `app/profile/ProfileClient.tsx` — prop `locale?: string`; sezioni localizzate: titolo pagina, Abbonamento, Premium Attivo, Identità, Dati demografici, Personalità Morale, Collezione Trofei, Il tuo Impatto, Salva Profilo.

**Nessuna modifica a**: vote flow, Supabase queries, API routes, middleware auth, EN behavior (fallback invariato se `lang-pref !== it`).

**Cosa resta in inglese** (fuori scope):
- Copy interno admin tabs: Content, Content QA, AI Drafts, Blog, Monetization (testo descrittivo delle sezioni)
- Labels demografici ("Birth Year", "Gender", "Country") — non critico, dati tecnici
- STATUS_BADGE nel dashboard ("Pending review", "Live", "Rejected", "Flagged") — stabile, breve
- Companion + Daily Missions (componenti separati, non toccati in questo sprint)

**Verifiche eseguite**: `npm run typecheck` ✅ — `npm run build` ✅ (148 pagine) — `git diff --check` ✅ — `npm run validate:personality` ✅.

**Check manuale richiesto post-deploy**:
- `/admin?tab=voting` su mobile 375px: barre visibili o empty state chiaro
- Toggle 7d/14d funziona
- Dashboard con `lang-pref=it` (cookie): copy italiano principale visibile
- Dashboard con `lang-pref=en` o cookie assente: tutto in inglese

## Sprint completati — Homepage Performance Micro-Optimization (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: ridurre latenza homepage cold render dopo aver identificato che ogni nuovo deploy causa ISR cache miss con p95 ~2.4s (Run #3 post-config: 2.36s). Nessun cambiamento a behavior, voting flow, o caching play/results.

**Root cause identificata**: `app/page.tsx` faceva 4 call async sequenziali durante il cold render ISR:
1. `getDynamicScenarios()` — Redis GET (necessario per allScenarios)
2. `getVotes(dailyScenario.id)` — Redis HGETALL separato (potenzialmente duplicato se daily era in batch)
3. `getVotesBatch(30 ids)` — **30 HTTP request separate** ad Upstash via `Promise.all`
4. `getTrendingScenarioIds24h(...)` — Supabase admin query (sequenziale dopo step 3)

Trending e category page fanno solo step 1 → p95 ~490–590ms. Homepage aveva 4 step → p95 2.4–3.2s cold.

**Fix applicati**:
- [x] `lib/redis.ts` — `getVotesBatch` convertito a Upstash pipeline: **30 HTTP call → 1 HTTP call**. Stessa semantica, stesso return type. Beneficia anche la trending fallback path.
- [x] `app/page.tsx` — rimosso import `getVotes` (non più necessario); daily scenario ID incluso nel batch (elimina 1 Redis call separata); `getVotesBatch` e `getTrendingScenarioIds24h` parallelizzati con `Promise.allSettled` (step 2+3+4 → 2 step paralleli).
- [x] `next.config.js` — aggiunto `poweredByHeader: false` (rimuove header `X-Powered-By: Next.js`).
- [x] `LOAD_TEST_RESULTS.md` — Run #3 registrato (2.36s cold, tutti gli altri threshold OK).
- [x] `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md` — nota homepage cold cache pattern e fix applicato.

**Performance attesa post-deploy**: homepage cold render ~800–1200ms (da ~2400ms). ISR warm invariato (~1.28s già era k6 pass). Rerun k6 richiesto per misurare.

**Nessuna modifica a**: vote flow, Redis vote atomicity, Stripe, play/results caching, Supabase schema, API routes, SEO/hreflang, behavior visivo.

**Prossimo step**: rerun k6 smoke post-deploy → se `/` p95 < 1500ms con cold render → baseline confermato. Poi Stripe QA end-to-end (runbook in `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md`).

---

## Sprint completati — Pre-launch Code Health Audit (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: ridurre rischio tecnico pre-lancio applicando solo fix a basso rischio. Nessuna modifica a runtime behavior, vote flow, Stripe, caching, DB schema.

- [x] **`next.config.js` consolidato** — eliminati `next.config.mjs` e `next.config.ts` (file duplicati ignorati o potenzialmente ambigui con Next.js 14.2). Config unica `next.config.js` ora include: `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true` (ESLint 8/9 incompatibility), header `X-XSS-Protection`, header `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control`, commento CSP, commento `payment=(self)` per Stripe. Tutti gli altri security header invariati.
- [x] **`postcss.config.mjs` eliminato** — usava `@tailwindcss/postcss` non presente in `package.json`; `postcss.config.js` (CJS con tailwindcss + autoprefixer) rimane l'unica config PostCSS attiva.
- [x] **README cron schedule corretto** — l'esempio codice nella sezione Vercel Cron mostrava `0 8 * * *` ma `vercel.json` ha `0 6 * * *` (6am UTC). Allineati.
- [x] **Personality validation**: ✅ 18 archetipi, VALID_IDS, ARCHETYPE_HEX, SIGN_COLORS — tutti coerenti.

**Verifiche eseguite**: `npm run typecheck` ✅ — `npm run build` ✅ (148 pagine statiche) — `git diff --check` ✅ — `npm run validate:personality` ✅.

**Non modificato** (fuori scope o deliberatamente invariato):
- `force-dynamic` + `generateStaticParams` su play/results — per-user data, nessuna cache per anti-regression rule. play/results p95 < 600ms a ~30 req/s già verificato con k6 spike.
- `SLOT_HOME ?? 'TODO'` in `app/page.tsx` — AdSlot renders null su 'TODO'; safe, intenzionale.
- `push_*.command` untracked — mai committare, confermato.
- Admin page 632 righe — refactor post-lancio.
- Duplicazione EN/IT pages — refactor post-lancio.

**Performance status: ✅ INVARIATO** — baseline smoke + spike production results invariati (nessuna modifica a runtime o caching).

**Prossimo step consigliato**: eseguire Stripe QA end-to-end (runbook in `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md`), poi Spanish i18n foundation.

---

## Sprint completati — k6 Production Spike Tests (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: eseguire e registrare spike test read-only su produzione con lo script dedicato. Docs only.

- [x] **Spike #1** (10 VU × 30s): overall p95 847ms, play p95 617ms, results p95 614ms, 355 req, 11.59 req/s — ✅ PASS
- [x] **Spike #2** (25 VU × 60s, ~30 req/s): overall p95 777ms, play p95 564ms, results p95 580ms, 1819 req, 29.91 req/s — ✅ PASS
- [x] `LOAD_TEST_RESULTS.md` — Spike #1 e Spike #2 registrati con dati completi; conclusione spike aggiunta.
- [x] `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md` — subsection spike aggiornata con risultati reali + no-50-VU-prod warning.

**Performance status: ✅ PASSED** — soft launch baseline + moderate social spike (25 VU, ~30 req/s). play/results p95 < 600ms sotto carico moderato.

**Nessuna modifica a**: codice runtime, script k6, API routes, DB schema.

**Prossimo step consigliato**: Stripe QA end-to-end (runbook in `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md`), poi Spanish i18n foundation. Per spike più aggressivi (50 VU): eseguire prima su Preview.

---

## Sprint completati — k6 Spike Test Script (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: aggiungere script k6 dedicato per simulare spike virale TikTok/Instagram. Read-only, weighted routing, `default` export per `--vus`/`--duration` CLI override.

- [x] `tests/load/splitvote-spike-load.js` — safety guard produzione, weighted routing (45% /play, 25% /results, 15% /, 10% /trending, 5% /category), cumulative random picker, `default` export (supporta `k6 run --vus N --duration Xs`), options default 10 VU × 60s, thresholds: `http_req_failed < 5%`, `checks > 95%`, overall p95 < 3s, `/play` p95 < 3s, `/results` p95 < 3s.
- [x] `package.json` — aggiunto script `"load:spike"`.
- [x] `LOAD_TEST_RESULTS.md` — sezione "Spike Tests" con comandi Preview (25/50 VU), produzione (25 VU solo dopo Preview OK), soglie, tabella risultati spike.
- [x] `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md` — subsection spike test con comando Preview e avvertenza produzione.

**`--vus`/`--duration` CLI override**: funziona perché lo script usa `export default function` (non `scenarios` nominati). Il k6 smoke test usava `scenarios: { reads: { exec: 'readTest' } }` che non è compatibile con i flag CLI.

**Nessuna modifica a**: runtime app, API routes, smoke test esistente, DB schema, dipendenze.

**Manual step**: eseguire Preview spike 25 VU × 60s e registrare risultati in `LOAD_TEST_RESULTS.md` → Spike Tests.

---

## Sprint completati — k6 Production Baseline (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: eseguire e registrare baseline read-only k6 su produzione. Docs only.

- [x] Due run read-only su produzione (5 VU, 30s, no `ENABLE_WRITE_TESTS`):
  - **Run #1** (cold cache): homepage p95 3.20s — k6 threshold fail (warmup); tutti gli altri passati; zero errori.
  - **Run #2** (warm): tutti i k6 threshold passati — homepage 1.28s, play 545ms, results 553ms, http_req_failed 0%, checks 100%.
- [x] `LOAD_TEST_RESULTS.md` — Run #1 e Run #2 registrati con dati reali; stato baseline aggiornato.
- [x] `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md` — item k6 baseline marcato `[x]` con nota cold cache + passed.

**Soft launch performance baseline: ✅ PASSED** — tutti i k6 threshold passati al secondo run.

**Nessuna modifica a**: codice runtime, script k6, API routes, DB schema.

---

## Sprint completati — k6 Load Test Results Tracker (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: creare `LOAD_TEST_RESULTS.md` come registro strutturato dei risultati k6, con comando baseline, soglie, tabella di registrazione, e procedura di follow-up. Nessuna modifica al codice runtime.

- [x] `LOAD_TEST_RESULTS.md` — creato: scopo, comando baseline Preview read-only (`BASE_URL=...ALLOW_PROD_LOAD_TEST=true k6 run`), regola no `ENABLE_WRITE_TESTS` per primo run, parametri harness (5 VU / 30s / scenario `trolley`), tabella soglie (k6 threshold vs pass target audit), tabella risultati con colonne date/commit/environment/BASE_URL/p95 per tutte e 5 le route/http_req_failed/checks/notes, Run #1 placeholder, procedura post-baseline (20 VU su Preview → poi prod finestra controllata), istruzioni lettura output k6, riferimenti.
- [x] `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md` — item `[ ] Eseguire baseline k6` aggiornato per puntare a `LOAD_TEST_RESULTS.md`; nota aggiunta in fondo alla sezione "Vercel Preview baseline".

**Nessuna modifica a**: codice runtime, script k6, API routes, DB schema, dipendenze.

**Manual step**: ottenere URL Vercel Preview → eseguire comando baseline → incollare p95 e metriche nel Run #1 di `LOAD_TEST_RESULTS.md`.

---

## Sprint completati — Stripe QA Runbook (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: preparare runbook operativo Stripe QA end-to-end in `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md`. Nessuna modifica al codice runtime.

- [x] `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md` — sezione "Stripe QA End-to-End" espansa con runbook completo: tabella endpoint + eventi webhook gestiti, prerequisiti env, setup Stripe CLI, test checkout premium (carta `4242...`), verifica `profiles` post-checkout (`is_premium`, `stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_subscription_id`, `subscription_status`), test dashboard Premium active, test no-ads (`/api/me/entitlements` → `noAds: true`), test customer portal, test cancellation + verifica `profiles` reset, test idempotency duplicate event (`stripe events resend`), test 6 failure modes (firma errata, already-premium, no billing account, admin rename, config mancante), note rollback SQL manuale + query `stripe_webhook_events` falliti, Stripe retry schedule.

**Nessuna modifica a**: codice runtime, API routes, DB schema, Stripe pricing, env vars, cookie consent, legal pages, vote flow.

**Manual step**: eseguire la QA reale con Stripe CLI e carta test prima di promuovere Premium a utenti reali (checklist completa in `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md` → Stripe QA End-to-End).

---

## Sprint completati — Streak Milestones (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: aggiungere badge milestone per streak 7/15/30 giorni, con progresso visibile su dashboard e profilo. Nessuna nuova gamification complessa, nessun leaderboard, nessuno shop.

**Schema audit**:
- `streak_7` già definito in migration_v2 + già assegnato in `increment_user_vote_count` (migration_v3) ✅
- `streak_15` e `streak_30`: assenti — aggiunti in migration_v14
- `user_badges.UNIQUE(user_id, badge_id)`: idempotent by design ✅
- RLS `user_badges`: SELECT public, INSERT solo via DB function (security definer) — nessun client INSERT ✅
- Integration point corretto: `app/api/vote/route.ts:240` → `supabase.rpc('increment_user_vote_count', ...)` ✅

- [x] `supabase/migration_v14_streak_milestone_badges.sql` — seed `streak_15` (epic) + `streak_30` (legendary); updated `increment_user_vote_count` DB function per awardarli; backfill per utenti esistenti con `streak_days >= threshold`; idempotente. **✅ Applied — verificata in Supabase (streak_7/15/30 presenti, `increment_user_vote_count` aggiornata, backfill vuoto normale).**
- [x] `lib/badges.ts` — `STREAK_MILESTONES` const; `getStreakProgress(streakDays)` helper per progress bar UI; `awardStreakMilestoneBadges(userId, streakDays)` per uso admin/manutenzione (primary award path resta DB function)
- [x] `app/dashboard/page.tsx` — card "🔥 Streak Milestones" con progress bar verso prossimo target + lista dei 3 badge (earned/not earned); degrada gracefully se migration_v14 non applicata
- [x] `app/profile/page.tsx` — aggiunto `streak_days` al SELECT query
- [x] `app/profile/ProfileClient.tsx` — aggiunto `streakDays` prop; stats grid 3→4 colonne con "Day streak 🔥"
- [x] `README.md` — migration_v14 aggiunta come ⏳ Pending
- [x] `PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md` — streak milestones segnato come foundation implementata

**Award flow**: voto → `increment_user_vote_count` (DB security definer) → aggiorna streak → `INSERT INTO user_badges ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. Nessun path client-side.

**Degrada gracefully**: se migration_v14 non applicata, badge streak_15/30 non esistono in `badges` → non possono essere in `user_badges` → UI mostra "not earned" correttamente. Dashboard funziona sempre con `streakDays`.

**Nessuna modifica a**: DB schema strutturale, Stripe, auth, vote logic, tracking, AdSense, cookie consent, legal pages, voting flow.

**Migration v14**: ✅ Applied e verificata manualmente in Supabase — nessuno step manuale residuo.

---

## Sprint completati — Personality v2 QA — Copy Audit + Validation Script (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: micro-sprint QA su copy EN/IT, consistency cross-file, e script di validazione automatica.

- [x] `lib/personality.ts` — refusi e copy corretti: `'Liberatarian'` → `'Libertarian'` in `MORAL_AXES`; 3× `'Principiato'` (guardian, idealist, stoic traitsIt) → `'Di principio'`; `'Collective'` (idealist, advocate traits EN) → `'Collaborative'` / `'Community-driven'`; `'Collettivo'` (idealist, advocate traitsIt) → `'Collaborativo'` / `'Solidale'`; `'Orientato ai risultati'` (pioneer traitsIt) → `'Determinato'` (evita duplicato con pragmatist IT)
- [x] `scripts/validate-personality.mjs` — nuovo script di validazione: 18 archetipi, ID unici, original 6 presenti, diplomat at index 3, EN/IT fields presenti, traits/traitsIt stessa lunghezza, profile presente per tutti, cross-check VALID_IDS + ARCHETYPE_HEX + SIGN_COLORS; output ✅/❌/⚠
- [x] `package.json` — aggiunto `"validate:personality": "node scripts/validate-personality.mjs"`

**Nessun cambio a**: DB, Stripe, auth, vote flow, tracking, card API logic, profili target degli archetipi, significato strategico degli archetipi.

**Verifica**: `npm run validate:personality` → 13/13 checks ✅; `npm run typecheck` ✅; `npm run build` ✅.

---

## Sprint completati — Personality v2 (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: espandere gli archetipi morali da 6 a 18, migliorare copy EN/IT, aggiornare classificatore e share card API.

- [x] `lib/personality.ts` — 12 nuovi archetipi aggiunti (idealist, pragmatist, protector, truth-teller, pioneer, peacemaker, sentinel, advocate, visionary, maverick, stoic, caretaker); `profile?: Record<string, number>` aggiunto a interfaccia `Archetype`; `pickArchetype` riscritto con distanza euclidea dai profili target (più robusto con 18 archetipi vs heuristic score precedente); existing 6 invariati (id, copy, segni, emoji, colori)
- [x] `app/api/personality-card/route.tsx` — `VALID_IDS` espanso a tutti i 18 id; `ARCHETYPE_HEX` aggiornato con colori hex per tutti i 18
- [x] `app/personality/PersonalityClient.tsx` — `SIGN_COLORS` espanso con classi gradient Tailwind per tutti i 18 archetipi; fallback esistente `?? 'from-purple-600/20...'` preserved

**Archetypes 6→18**: guardian, rebel, oracle, diplomat, strategist, empath + idealist ✨, pragmatist ⚙️, protector 🛡️, truth-teller 💎, pioneer 🚀, peacemaker 🕊️, sentinel 🌅, advocate ✊, visionary 🌠, maverick ⚡, stoic ⛰️, caretaker 🤲

**Compatibilità**: id dei 6 archetipi esistenti invariati; il nuovo classificatore euclidean distance può assegnare archetipi diversi a utenti esistenti (normale — il profilo viene ricalcolato dai voti ogni volta, non è memorizzato in DB).

**No zodiac**: nessun dato di nascita, nessun segno zodiacale. Zodiac overlay resta future/opzionale.

**Nessuna modifica a**: DB schema, Stripe, auth, vote flow, tracking, AdSense, cookie consent, legal pages pubbliche.

---

## Sprint completati — Migrations v11/v12 Applied + RLS Audit + v13 (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: aggiornare docs per v11/v12 ora applicate; auditare policy residua UPDATE su `user_polls`; creare migration v13.

**Audit risultato UPDATE user_polls**:
- `user_polls.update` nel codice: solo `app/api/admin/polls/[id]/approve/route.ts` e `app/api/admin/polls/[id]/reject/route.ts` — entrambi usano `createAdminClient()` (service role, bypassa RLS)
- Nessuna feature client per edit pending poll
- Policy `Users can update own pending polls` è residua di schema.sql — attack surface: un utente autenticato potrebbe modificare il contenuto del poll durante il review dell'admin tramite Supabase REST API diretta, rendendo il review privo di significato

- [x] `README.md` — migration_v11 e migration_v12 aggiornate da ⏳ Pending a ✅ Applied; migration_v13 aggiunta come ⏳ Pending
- [x] `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md` — item idempotency webhook aggiornato a confermato; item poll submit/RLS aggiunto
- [x] `ROADMAP.md` — step operativi v11/v12 marcati completati; v13 aggiunto come prossimo step manuale
- [x] `LEGAL.md` — nota sprint: v11/v12 applicate, v13 audit
- [x] `supabase/migration_v13_user_polls_no_client_update.sql` — drop `Users can update own pending polls` + varianti; commenti spiegano perché e documentano le policy SELECT ancora necessarie

**Nessun runtime behavior modificato**: nessuna modifica a API, auth, vote flow, Stripe, entitlements, tracking, legal pages.

**Manual step**: applicare `migration_v13` in Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor → Run.

---

## Sprint completati — Poll Submit Hardening + RLS (28 Apr 2026)

**Obiettivo**: rendere la submission di poll production-safe — premium/admin enforcement server-side, input validation, RLS hardening.

**Audit RLS/sicurezza**:
- `app/submit-poll/page.tsx` faceva insert diretto client-side su `user_polls` — entitlement check era solo UI (bypassabile via Supabase REST API diretta)
- Nessuna validation server-side
- `schema.sql` non disponibile nel repo — stato RLS su `user_polls` sconosciuto, presumibilmente nessuna protezione INSERT adeguata

- [x] `app/api/polls/submit/route.ts` — nuova route POST: (1) auth via `supabase.auth.getUser()`; (2) entitlement check server-side con `getUserEntitlements` → 403 se non premium/admin; (3) input validation: question 10-300 chars, option_a/b 2-150 chars, category allowlist, emoji safe bound, controllo control-char; (4) insert via `createAdminClient()` con `status='pending'` e `user_id` dall'auth session — client non può impostare né status né user_id
- [x] `app/submit-poll/page.tsx` — rimosso insert diretto `supabase.from('user_polls').insert(...)`; usa `fetch('/api/polls/submit', { method: 'POST' })`; gestione errori 401/403/500; aggiunta checkbox obbligatoria "I confirm this submission follows the guidelines"; copy non-premium corretto: "Poll submission is available with Premium" + CTA upgrade (rimosso "coming soon")
- [x] `supabase/migration_v12_user_polls_rls_hardening.sql` — abilita RLS su `user_polls`, rimuove policy INSERT client, aggiunge policy SELECT per "own polls"; documenta pattern server-only insert
- [x] `LEGAL.md` — sprint note: UGC hardening, entitlement enforcement, input validation, RLS; Terms già coprono user-submitted content — nessun aggiornamento Terms/Privacy necessario
- [x] `README.md` — migration v12 aggiunta alla tabella

**Admin approve/reject invariato**: `app/api/admin/polls/[id]/approve|reject/route.ts` già usano `createAdminClient()` + `isAdminEmail()` — non modificati.

**Nessuna modifica a**: Stripe, pricing, entitlements logic, DB schema (oltre migration v12 RLS), tracking, legal pages, auth.

**Manual step**: applicare `supabase/migration_v12_user_polls_rls_hardening.sql` in Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor → Run.

---

## Sprint completati — Profile UX Cleanup + Premium Dashboard Simplification (28 Apr 2026)

- [x] `app/dashboard/page.tsx` — stats grid riorganizzata: sostituiti "Polls submitted / Polls live" (sempre 0 per la maggioranza degli utenti) con "XP earned" e "Day streak" — dati rilevanti per tutti gli account; copy Premium: "No ads · Unlimited renames · Submit polls" (specifico); copy Free: "Remove ads and unlock unlimited renames" (chiaro beneficio)
- [x] `app/profile/ProfileClient.tsx` — Moral Personality CTA spostata PRIMA della Trophy Case (era dopo il bottone Save — invisibile); rimossa sezione "Coming soon" con promesse false (Avatar shop, Frame shop, Streak tracker, Country leaderboard — nessuno implementato); lista benefit Premium corretta: rimossa "Exclusive avatar frames & badges" (non implementata), aggiunta "No ads — browse without interruptions" (implementata) e "Submit polls for the community to vote on" (implementata); rimossa nota "Premium packs coming soon" dall'avatar section
- [x] `app/u/[id]/page.tsx` — aggiunto badge "👁 Public Profile" nella hero del profilo pubblico, allineato con Premium badge esistente — chiarisce visivamente che la pagina è pubblica

**Nessuna modifica a**: Stripe, DB schema, entitlements, tracking, legal pages, auth. LEGAL.md non aggiornato — nessun cambio a dati pubblici, billing behavior, visibility default o ads behavior.

---

## Sprint completati — Post-Idempotency Verification Sprint (28 Apr 2026)

- [x] README.md — Stripe webhook runbook espanso: procedura di verifica step-by-step post-migration v11, test duplicate detection con `stripe events resend`, expected outcomes documentati
- [x] LAUNCH_AUDIT.md — idempotency item aggiornato (implementazione completata, awaiting migration v11 + verification); sezione k6 Vercel Preview baseline espansa con tabella metriche da registrare e istruzioni no-ENABLE_WRITE_TESTS per primo run
- [x] ROADMAP.md — "Prossimo Sprint Prioritario" ripulito: rimossi candidati completati (Stripe webhook idempotency, k6 harness); aggiunti step operativi pre-scaling (migration v11 apply, k6 Preview baseline) e candidati prodotto realistici
- [x] Nessun codice applicativo, DB, API, Stripe, Redis, auth o runtime behavior modificato

**Nota migration v11**: non è possibile verificare lo stato di Supabase da codice — resta ⏳ Pending fino a conferma manuale. La backward-compatibility garantisce che il webhook funzioni in entrambi i casi.

---

## Sprint completati — Stripe Webhook Idempotency Hardening (28 Apr 2026)

- [x] `lib/stripe-webhook-events.ts` — refactor hardening:
  - Reclaim di eventi `failed`: ora atomico con `UPDATE WHERE status='failed' RETURNING stripe_event_id`; due retry concorrenti serializzano su lock Postgres — solo chi ottiene la row vince, l'altro riceve array vuoto e ritorna `in_progress`
  - Stale processing recovery: se `updated_at` > `STALE_PROCESSING_AFTER_MS` (10 min), tenta `UPDATE WHERE status='processing' AND updated_at < cutoff RETURNING stripe_event_id`; il trigger `updated_at=now()` invalida la condizione per il secondo retry concorrente
  - Eliminata la race condition select→update non atomica del reclaim `failed`
  - Seleziona `status, updated_at` insieme in un unico round-trip invece di due
  - Tipo pubblico `ClaimResult` invariato; `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` invariato
- [x] `supabase/migration_v11_stripe_webhook_events.sql` — commenti aggiornati per documentare stale recovery e ruolo del trigger `updated_at`

**Nota:** `migration_v11` non è stata applicata — resta ⏳ Pending manuale in Supabase.

---

## Sprint completati — Stripe Webhook Idempotency (28 Apr 2026)

- [x] `supabase/migration_v11_stripe_webhook_events.sql` — tabella `stripe_webhook_events` con `stripe_event_id UNIQUE`, `status CHECK (processing/processed/failed)`, trigger `updated_at`, RLS abilitata (nessuna policy pubblica — service role bypassa RLS)
- [x] `lib/stripe-webhook-events.ts` — tre helper: `claimWebhookEvent()`, `markWebhookEventProcessed()`, `markWebhookEventFailed()`
- [x] `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` — integrazione idempotency: claim before processing, mark processed on success, mark failed + return 500 on error (so Stripe retries); estratto `processStripeEvent()` helper interno
- [x] **Backward-compatible**: se `migration_v11` non è ancora applicata, Postgres restituisce errore `42P01` (undefined_table) → il webhook processa come prima e logga `console.warn`; nessuna interruzione del servizio
- [x] Flusso status: `processing` → `processed` (successo) | `failed` (errore, Stripe ritenta) → reset `processing` (retry allowed)
- [x] Log sicuri: nessuna email, nome, payload Stripe o metadata sensibili — solo `userId.slice(0,8)`, `customerId.slice(0,12)`, error code DB
- [x] README.md — migration v11 aggiunta alla tabella, nota idempotency nella sezione Stripe webhook, Known Issues aggiornato, Stripe CLI commands documentati
- [x] LEGAL.md — nota nel recent sprints per audit trail webhook/payment

**Comportamento se migration non è applicata**: `claimWebhookEvent()` riceve `insertError.code === '42P01'` da Postgres → restituisce `{ claimed: true, fallback: true }` → webhook processa normalmente → `markProcessed`/`markFailed` ricevono `42P01` e sono no-op → `console.warn` in ogni caso. Zero breaking change per utenti finali.

**Prossimo step manuale**: applicare `supabase/migration_v11_stripe_webhook_events.sql` in Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor, poi verificare con `stripe trigger checkout.session.completed` tramite Stripe CLI che la riga venga creata in `stripe_webhook_events`.

---

## Sprint completati — k6 Load Test Harness (28 Apr 2026)

- [x] `tests/load/splitvote-smoke-load.js` — script k6 con safety guard produzione (aborto se `BASE_URL` contiene `splitvote.io` e `ALLOW_PROD_LOAD_TEST` non è `"true"`)
- [x] Scenari: 5 VU read-only per 30s (home, trending, category/technology, play/trolley, results/trolley); write scenario opzionale (1 req/s, 15s, POST /api/vote anonimo) attivo solo se `ENABLE_WRITE_TESTS=true`
- [x] Thresholds conservativi: p95 ISR < 1500ms, p95 force-dynamic < 3000ms, `http_req_failed` < 5%, checks > 90%
- [x] Metrica custom `vote_rate_limited` per tracciare % di 429 sul vote API
- [x] `package.json` — aggiunto script `load:smoke` → `k6 run tests/load/splitvote-smoke-load.js`
- [x] `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md` — sezione completa con installazione k6, comandi localhost/preview/prod, metriche da monitorare, definizione "pass" per soft launch, prossimo step consigliato
- [x] Nessun runtime behavior modificato — zero modifiche a API, Redis, Supabase, Stripe, AdSense, cookie consent

**Nota force-dynamic play/results**: il test misura esattamente il rischio identificato nell'audit: ogni VU che colpisce `/play/[id]` o `/results/[id]` genera un server render completo (Next.js + `cookies()` + `supabase.auth.getUser()` + Redis). A 5 VU concurrent il test è sicuro; aumentare gradualmente su Preview prima di produzione.

**Prossimo step**: eseguire baseline su Vercel Preview (`BASE_URL=https://..vercel.app ALLOW_PROD_LOAD_TEST=true k6 run tests/load/splitvote-smoke-load.js`) e poi eseguire stesso test su produzione in orario basso traffico prima di campagne paid.

## Sprint completati — Claude Code Governance Docs (28 Apr 2026)

- [x] `CLAUDE.md` — guida operativa root con stack, source-of-truth docs, aree sensibili, regole anti-regressione, workflow e definition of done
- [x] `.claude/agents/security-reviewer.md` — reviewer per auth/admin/API/Stripe/input/log/security
- [x] `.claude/agents/seo-content-reviewer.md` — reviewer per SEO, hreflang, metadata, JSON-LD, content quality e social sharing
- [x] `.claude/agents/release-readiness-reviewer.md` — reviewer per ship/no-ship, verifiche, rischio deploy e fine giornata
- [x] `.claude/agents/product-growth-reviewer.md` — reviewer per retention, share loop, gamification, premium, i18n e scoping sprint
- [x] Nessun codice applicativo, DB, API, Stripe, Supabase, Redis, AdSense o runtime behavior modificato

## Sprint completati — Social Share + Insight + Content QA Polish (28 Apr 2026)

- [x] `app/play/[id]/VoteClientPage.tsx` — aggiunto pulsante "Share this dilemma" / "Condividi questo dilemma" pre-voto: Web Share API + clipboard fallback; solo domanda + link, zero percentuali
- [x] `app/results/[id]/ResultsClientPage.tsx` — `webShareText` ora sempre aggregato (maggioranza, non voto utente); rimossa riga "I voted:" / "Ho votato:" da `instagramCaption`; `storyCardUrl` senza parametro `voted`
- [x] `app/api/story-card/route.tsx` — rimosso `votedLabel` ("You chose" / "Hai scelto"); colori barre uniformi (nessuna evidenza del voto personale); parametro `voted` rimosso
- [x] `lib/expert-insights.ts` — migliorati `whyPeopleSplit` per `morality` (soglia che attiva ciascun sistema etico) e `loyalty` (lealtà si sente, equità si ragiona)
- [x] `app/personality/PersonalityClient.tsx` — fix IT bug: `loginHref` ora `/login?locale=it` per utenti IT non loggati
- [x] `lib/dynamic-scenarios.ts` — aggiunto `patchApprovedScenario(id, fields)` per patch testo su scenari Redis approvati
- [x] `app/api/admin/dilemmas/[id]/route.ts` — nuovo endpoint `PATCH /api/admin/dilemmas/[id]` per correggere refusi in scenari Redis (admin-only); usare per correggere `dipendeme` → `dipendente` sullo scenario IT segnalato
- [x] Nessun DB schema, nessun paid feature, nessun nuovo tracking

**Nota fix typo Redis**: per correggere `dipendeme` → `dipendente` sullo scenario AI approvato:
1. `GET /api/admin/dilemmas?locale=it&status=approved` → trova l'`id` dello scenario con il refuso
2. `PATCH /api/admin/dilemmas/{id}` con body `{ "optionA": "..." }` (o il campo corretto)

---

## Sprint completati — Guided Category Path MVP (28 Apr 2026)

- [x] `lib/scenarios.ts` — aggiunto `getFreshNextScenarioIdByCategory(category, currentId, votedIds, dynamicPool)`: esclude già-votati, preferisce dynamic top-half per categoria, fallback statici
- [x] `lib/scenarios-it.ts` — aggiunto `CATEGORY_LABELS_IT` per nomi italiani delle categorie
- [x] Category pages EN/IT — CTA "Start path →" / "Inizia percorso →" che linka al primo dilemma della categoria con `?path=[cat]&step=1&target=3`
- [x] Play pages EN/IT — leggono `?path`, `?step`, `?target`; calcolano `nextPathId`; passano props a VoteClientPage; progress indicator "Category · step/target" sopra la domanda
- [x] VoteClientPage — path props; cookie-redirect preserva path params; `submitVote` redirect preserva path params; CTA "already voted" route-aware
- [x] Results pages EN/IT — leggono path params; calcolano `nextPathId` via `getFreshNextScenarioIdByCategory`; passano tutto a ResultsClientPage
- [x] ResultsClientPage — CTA section path-aware: "Continue path →" (step < target), "Path complete 🎉" + browse (step = target), "No fresh dilemmas" (esaurito); progress indicator inline
- [x] Nessun DB schema, nessun auth change, nessun paid feature, nessun nuovo tracking oltre eventi GA già esistenti

---

## Sprint completati — Admin Content QA Editor (28 Apr 2026)

- [x] `app/admin/ScenarioQAEditor.tsx` — nuovo client component con search full-text, filtro locale EN/IT/All, editing inline per `question`/`optionA`/`optionB`/`seoTitle`/`seoDescription`, char counter per campo, salvataggio via `PATCH /api/admin/dilemmas/[id]`, update ottimistico lista locale
- [x] `app/admin/page.tsx` — aggiunta tab "Content QA" con `ScenarioQAEditor`
- [x] Ora possibile correggere `dipendeme` → `dipendente` direttamente dalla tab Content QA senza deploy

---

## Sprint completati — Performance Safety Audit (28 Apr 2026)

### Audit table — ogni route classificata

| Route | Stato | Decisione | Motivo |
|---|---|---|---|
| `app/page.tsx` | `revalidate=3600` | ✅ Corretto | No per-user state — Redis + trending aggregati |
| `app/it/page.tsx` | `revalidate=3600` | ✅ Corretto | Idem |
| `app/trending/page.tsx` | `revalidate=3600` | ✅ Corretto | Solo scenari Redis aggregati, no auth |
| `app/it/trending/page.tsx` | `revalidate=3600` | ✅ Corretto | Idem |
| `app/category/[category]/page.tsx` | `revalidate=3600` | ✅ Corretto + `dynamicParams=false` aggiunto | No per-user state; 8 slug noti a build time |
| `app/it/category/[category]/page.tsx` | `revalidate=3600` | ✅ Corretto + `dynamicParams=false` aggiunto | Idem |
| `app/play/[id]/page.tsx` | `force-dynamic` | ✅ **Deve restare dynamic** | Legge `cookies()` (sv_voted_* anon) + `supabase.auth.getUser()` (existingVote, canChangeUntil) + `votedIds` per nextId personalizzato |
| `app/it/play/[id]/page.tsx` | `force-dynamic` | ✅ **Deve restare dynamic** | Idem (path IT) |
| `app/results/[id]/page.tsx` | `force-dynamic` | ✅ **Deve restare dynamic** | Legge `cookies()` + Supabase votedIds per nextId/nextPathId personalizzato; live vote counts; `dateModified` in JSON-LD |
| `app/it/results/[id]/page.tsx` | `force-dynamic` | ✅ **Deve restare dynamic** | Idem (path IT) |

### Nota su `generateStaticParams` + `force-dynamic` su play/results
Il piano di audit citava questa combinazione come "contraddizione". È corretto dal punto di vista meccanico Next.js, ma la soluzione corretta **non è** rimuovere `force-dynamic`. Le pagine play/results rendono stato per-user (voto esistente, cookie anonimi, next dilemma personalizzato) su ogni richiesta. Non è possibile cachiarle senza rompere queste funzionalità. Il `generateStaticParams()` su quelle pagine è dead code che può essere rimosso in un futuro refactor, ma non ha impatto negativo.

### Modifiche applicate
- `app/category/[category]/page.tsx` — aggiunto `export const dynamicParams = false`
- `app/it/category/[category]/page.tsx` — aggiunto `export const dynamicParams = false`

Effetto: slug di categoria non esistenti (es. `/category/fake`) ricevono 404 immediato dal framework invece di invocare server code e poi `notFound()`.

---

## Prossimo Sprint Prioritario — da definire

### Step operativi pre-scaling (no codice, solo ops)

- [x] **migration v11 applicata e verificata** (28 Apr 2026): `stripe_webhook_events` esiste, trigger `updated_at` presente, RLS abilitato, zero policy client, comportamento dedup confermato
- [x] **migration v12 applicata** (28 Apr 2026): `user_polls` RLS attivo, INSERT client bloccato; policy "Anyone can view approved polls" + "Users can view own polls" presenti
- [x] **migration v13 applicata e verificata** (28 Apr 2026): policy "Users can update own pending polls" rimossa; restano solo "Anyone can view approved polls" + "Users can view own polls" — `user_polls` write path server-only completamente hardened (v11 + v12 + v13)
- [x] **k6 production read-only baseline completato** (28 Apr 2026): Run #1 cold cache homepage 3.20s (threshold fail); Run #2 tutti passati — play 545ms, results 553ms, 0% errors, 100% checks. Risultati in `LOAD_TEST_RESULTS.md`.
- [x] **k6 production spike test completato** (28 Apr 2026): Spike #1 10 VU/30s overall p95 847ms; Spike #2 25 VU/60s overall p95 777ms, play 564ms, results 580ms — entrambi PASS. Risultati in `LOAD_TEST_RESULTS.md`. No 50 VU produzione senza Preview o finestra controllata.

### Candidati prodotto

- **Stripe QA end-to-end** ← priorità alta: runbook pronto in `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md` — eseguire con Stripe CLI e carta test prima di promuovere Premium a utenti reali
- **i18n espansione `es`**: prossima lingua spagnolo — seguire pattern middleware + route duplicate + CATEGORY_LABELS_ES; attendere metriche traffico IT prima di iniziare
- ~~**Streak milestones**~~: ✅ completato (sprint 28 Apr 2026)

---

## Sprint completati — Personality Share Card (28 Apr 2026)

- [x] `app/api/personality-card/route.tsx` — edge `ImageResponse` 1080×1920 PNG per tutti e 6 gli archetipi, EN/IT
- [x] `PersonalityClient.tsx` — aggiunto pulsante "Save card" / "Salva card" con `<a download>` accanto al pulsante Share

- [x] Copy: "Based on my SplitVote choices" + disclaimer entertainment-only nella card
- [x] Nessuna API social, nessun auto-post, nessun nuovo DB schema, nessun nuovo tracking

---

## Sprint completati — Fresh Next Dilemma + Vote Grace UX (28 Apr 2026)

- [x] `lib/scenarios.ts` — aggiunto `getFreshNextScenarioId(currentId, votedIds, dynamicPool)` che esclude currentId + tutti i già-votati
- [x] Utenti loggati: query Supabase ottimizzata (una sola query) raccoglie tutti i voti incluso quello corrente
- [x] Utenti anonimi: cookie `sv_voted_*` letti server-side via `cookies()` da `next/headers`
- [x] Fallback: `nextId = null` quando tutte le domande disponibili sono già state votate; bottone "Browse all" / "Sfoglia tutti" EN/IT
- [x] `VoteClientPage.tsx` — grace UX 3 secondi: countdown con [Undo] / [Confirm now], `prefers-reduced-motion` respected, click stesso bottone = conferma immediata
- [x] `ResultsClientPage.tsx` — `nextId: string | null`, copy `browsedAll` EN/IT
- [x] Nessuna modifica API, nessun nuovo DB schema, nessun nuovo tracking
- [x] Base per path gamificati: `getFreshNextScenarioId` accetta `votedIds: Set<string>` — pronto per filtrare per categoria

---

## Sprint completati — Profile UX + Personality Entry Point (28 Apr 2026)

- [x] Personality CTA card nel Dashboard (server component, locked/unlocked via votesCount)
- [x] Personality entry card in ProfileClient con progress bar se < 3 voti

---

## Sprint completati — Security Hardening Pre-Scaling (28 Apr 2026)

- [x] Open Redirect fix: `lib/safe-redirect.ts` — `safeRedirect()` su `auth/callback` e `login/page`
- [x] JSON-LD XSS fix: `JsonLd.tsx` escapa `<`/`>`/`&`; tutti i JSON-LD inline ora sicuri
- [x] GA proxy: `/api/_g/script` ignora `id` user-supplied, usa solo GA ID configurato
- [x] API input bounds: metadata cap 2KB, scenarioId pattern, countryCode regex, avatarEmoji length, displayName control chars
- [x] Log safety: nome utente rimosso da Stripe webhook log; profile error log ridotto a error code
- [x] Docs: README Security Notes, ROADMAP sprint, LAUNCH_AUDIT aggiornato

---

## Stato Attuale

### Roadmap — Gamification & Social Identity

**Obiettivo prodotto:** evolvere SplitVote da voting game virale a piattaforma di identità sociale basata su scelte, progressi, status e ricompense.

Loop strategico:

`Engagement → Identità → Status → Monetizzazione`

#### Cosa esiste già

- [x] Voto anonimo frictionless: nessun account richiesto per votare
- [x] Account opzionale con storico voti, XP, streak, badge e missioni daily
- [x] `profiles.xp`, `profiles.streak_days`, `profiles.streak_last_date` da `migration_v3_engagement.sql`
- [x] Tabelle `badges` e `user_badges` da `migration_v2_safe.sql`
- [x] `mission_completions` + funzione DB `award_mission_xp`
- [x] Daily missions server-validate in `GET /api/missions` e `POST /api/missions/complete`
- [x] Profilo pubblico base `/u/[id]`
- [x] `equipped_badge` e `equipped_frame` già presenti su `profiles` come base per cosmetici futuri
- [x] Entitlements centralizzati in `lib/entitlements.ts`

#### Cosa è solo pianificato

- [ ] Bacheca pubblica utente con layout curato per badge/trofei
- [ ] Privacy controls granulari sul profilo pubblico
- [ ] Trofei unici per eventi limitati
- [ ] Quest globali, settimanali, evento e categoria
- [ ] Geo quest privacy-safe
- [ ] Leaderboard aggregate
- [ ] Share card profilo/badge/trofeo
- [ ] Cosmetic shop: skin bacheca, cornici profilo, avatar speciali, bundle premium

#### Principi prodotto

- Voto sempre frictionless
- Login mai obbligatorio per votare
- Account utile per identità, progressi e ricompense
- Nessun pay-to-win
- Monetizzazione: cosmetici, no-ads/premium utility, non manipolazione dei risultati
- Privacy-first per geo quest
- I premi conquistati devono valere più dei premi acquistati
- Evitare over-engineering prima della validazione traffico/retention

#### Fase 1 — Core Gamification

- [ ] Streak milestones 7/15/30 giorni
- [ ] Badge base:
  - First Vote
  - 10 Votes
  - 100 Votes
  - 7-Day Streak
  - 30-Day Streak
- [ ] Profilo base con badge visibili
- [ ] Nessuna monetizzazione obbligatoria
- [ ] QA: reward server-side, nessun award client-trusted

#### Fase 2 — Public Profile / Bacheca

- [ ] Profilo pubblico condivisibile
- [ ] Bacheca badge/trofei
- [ ] Statistiche pubbliche opzionali
- [ ] Privacy controls per mostrare/nascondere elementi
- [ ] Share card profilo
- [ ] Default sicuro: mostrare solo informazioni non sensibili e chiaramente pubbliche

#### Fase 3 — Quest System

- [ ] Daily quest evolute
- [ ] Weekly quest
- [ ] Event quest
- [ ] Quest per categoria
- [ ] Path guidati per categoria, es. "3 domande technology", evitando dilemmi già votati
- [ ] Premi: XP, badge, trofei
- [ ] Server-side verification obbligatoria
- [ ] Niente reward basati su azioni non verificabili

#### Fase 4 — Geo Quest

- [ ] Quest per nazione
- [ ] Quest per città
- [ ] Quest per quartiere solo se privacy-safe
- [ ] Leaderboard aggregate
- [ ] Niente tracciamento preciso obbligatorio
- [ ] Geografia dichiarata volontariamente dall'utente come fonte primaria per città/quest
- [ ] IP geolocation solo approssimativa, opt-in/consenso esplicito se usata per feature prodotto, mai con raw IP salvato
- [ ] Soglie minime di campione per evitare identificazione indiretta

#### Fase 5 — Unique Trophies

- [ ] Trofei per eventi limitati
- [ ] Trofei non acquistabili
- [ ] Trofei per vincitori di quest
- [ ] Trofei per costanza:
  - 7 giorni
  - 15 giorni
  - 30 giorni
  - 3 mesi
  - 1 anno
  - 10 anni
- [ ] Regola: i trofei più prestigiosi devono essere earned-only

#### Fase 6 — Cosmetic Monetization

- [ ] Skin bacheca
- [ ] Cornici profilo
- [ ] Avatar speciali
- [ ] Bundle premium
- [ ] Oggetti acquistabili
- [ ] Oggetti ottenibili solo tramite quest
- [ ] Oggetti ottenibili solo tramite anzianità/streak
- [ ] I cosmetici non alterano risultati di voto, ranking, conteggi o visibilità dell'opinione

#### Modello concettuale futuro (non implementare ora)

| Entity | Scopo | Campi principali ipotetici | Priorità | Dipendenze |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Badge` | Ricompensa ricorrente/base | id, name, description, icon, rarity, unlock_rule, category | Alta | `badges` esiste già |
| `Trophy` | Ricompensa unica/status | id, name, description, icon, rarity, event_id, earned_only, limited_until | Media | Quest/event system |
| `UserBadge` | Badge assegnato a utente | user_id, badge_id, earned_at, equipped | Alta | `user_badges` esiste già |
| `UserTrophy` | Trofeo assegnato a utente | user_id, trophy_id, earned_at, source_event, display_order | Media | Trophy + quest/event |
| `Quest` | Obiettivo verificabile | id, type, locale, category, starts_at, ends_at, requirements, rewards | Alta | Mission validation |
| `QuestProgress` | Stato utente su quest | user_id, quest_id, progress, completed_at, claimed_at | Alta | Quest |
| `ProfileCosmetic` | Oggetto cosmetico | id, type, name, rarity, source, price, availability, preview_asset | Bassa | Cosmetic economy |
| `UserCosmetic` | Oggetto posseduto | user_id, cosmetic_id, acquired_at, source, equipped | Bassa | ProfileCosmetic |
| `PublicProfile` | Config pubblica profilo | user_id, slug, visibility, shown_stats, shown_badges, shown_trophies, board_theme | Media | Privacy controls |

#### Cosmetic Economy

Tipi oggetti:

- `earned-only`: ottenibili solo con attività, streak, quest o eventi
- `purchasable-only`: acquistabili direttamente, valore estetico
- `event-limited`: disponibili solo durante eventi specifici
- `founder/early-user`: ricompense per early adopters
- `streak/anniversary`: legati ad anzianità o costanza
- `premium-bundle`: inclusi in abbonamento o pacchetto premium

Regole:

- Non vendere vantaggi sul voto
- Non vendere risultati
- Non manipolare classifiche
- Evitare gambling/loot box nella prima versione
- Prezzi piccoli, chiari e non predatori
- Separare chiaramente "earned prestige" da "paid style"

#### Ordine consigliato di implementazione

1. Completare soft launch e validare traffico
2. Introdurre badge/streak minimi
3. Creare profilo pubblico semplice
4. Aggiungere share card badge/profilo
5. Introdurre quest globali
6. Solo dopo traffico reale: geo quest
7. Solo dopo engagement reale: cosmetic shop

#### Cosa NON implementare ora

- Geo quest con geolocalizzazione precisa
- Leaderboard personali pubbliche senza privacy controls
- Shop cosmetico prima di avere retention reale
- Loot box, random rewards acquistabili o meccaniche gambling-like
- Reward basati su eventi non verificabili server-side
- Login obbligatorio nel voting flow

### Sprint Completato — Admin Pro Dashboard + Content Tools (27 Apr 2026)

  - Claude genera `insightBody`, `insightWhySplit`, `insightPerspectiveA/B` come campi opzionali
  - Mapping nei candidate → `expertInsightEn` o `expertInsightIt` a seconda del locale
  - Admin review obbligatoria — mai pubblicati senza approvazione

**Guardrail professionali:**
- Mai: "sei X tipo di persona", diagnosi, prognosi, consiglio clinico
- Sempre: "may suggest", "could indicate", "might reflect" + disclaimer
- AI insights: draft-only → review obbligatoria → approvazione admin → pubblico

### Sprint Completato — AI Content Hardening + Audit (27 Apr 2026)

**Quality gates autopublish + content opportunities + launch audit ✅**

- [x] `lib/content-quality-gates.ts`: funzione centralizzata `runQualityGates(input)` — 12 hard gates + 3 warnings
  - Locale valido en/it
  - Question length 20-300 chars
  - OptionA/B length 5-200 chars, max 4:1 ratio
  - SEO title (10-120) e description (20-320) presenti
  - Category valida (8 categorie)
  - Blocklist contenuti pericolosi (espanso da cron BLOCKED_PATTERNS)
  - Language match: IT richiede ≥2 segnali italiani nel testo
  - noveltyScore ≥ 75 per autopublish (stricter di 55 draft threshold)
  - finalScore ≥ 75 per autopublish
  - similarItems count ≤ 2
  - Output: `{ passed, score, reasons[], warnings[] }`
- [x] `lib/dynamic-scenarios.ts`: campi opzionali `autoPublished`, `qualityGateScore`, `qualityGateReasons`, `generatedBy` in `DynamicScenario`
- [x] `app/api/cron/generate-dilemmas/route.ts`: autopublish condizionale
  - `AUTO_PUBLISH_DILEMMAS=true` richiesto esplicitamente — fail closed per default
  - `AUTO_PUBLISH_DILEMMAS_MAX_PER_RUN` (default 1) — max dilemmi auto-approvati per run
  - Quality gates passati → `saveDynamicScenarios()` direttamente (approvato)
  - Quality gates falliti → `saveDraftScenarios()` come prima
  - Metadata salvati: `autoPublished: true`, `qualityGateScore`, `generatedBy: 'cron'`
  - Risultati: `autoPublished` + `savedToDraft` nel response JSON
- [x] `app/api/admin/content-opportunities/route.ts`: GET admin-only read-only
  - Ranked dilemmi più votati (Redis vote counts)
  - Blog topic suggestions per ciascun dilemma (template-based, zero cost AI)
  - Category gaps: categorie senza articolo blog in EN/IT
  - Autopublish status live
- [x] `app/admin/CronDebug.tsx`: badge ⚡ AUTO (cyan) per dilemmi auto-pubblicati; badge QG:{score} per qualityGateScore
- [x] `README.md`: env vars `AUTO_PUBLISH_DILEMMAS`, `AUTO_PUBLISH_DILEMMAS_MAX_PER_RUN`, `BLOG_WEEKLY_DRAFTS`
- [x] `LAUNCH_AUDIT.md`: audit completo stato progetto

**Regole autopublish (da rispettare in tutti gli sprint futuri):**
- `AUTO_PUBLISH_DILEMMAS=false` per default — MAI abilitare senza review quality gates
- Quality gate threshold autopublish: noveltyScore ≥ 75, finalScore ≥ 75 (vs draft threshold 55)
- Blog: NON autopubblicato — richiede storage migration (vedi sotto)
- Admin vede sempre badge ⚡ AUTO sui dilemmi auto-pubblicati

### Blog Weekly Generation — Piano Tecnico (da implementare in sprint dedicato)

**Problema**: il blog è attualmente hardcodato in `lib/blog.ts`. Un cron non può modificare file TypeScript in produzione senza commit/deploy.

**Soluzione consigliata**: Redis `blog:drafts` + `blog:published` (pattern identico ai dilemmi)

**Piano dettagliato**:

1. **Storage**: due Redis keys
   - `blog:drafts` (max 10) — bozze generate dal cron
   - `blog:published` (max 30) — articoli approvati per pubblicazione
   - Struttura: array di `BlogDraft` objects con tutti i campi di `BlogPost` + `status: 'draft' | 'published'`

2. **Endpoint generazione**: `POST /api/admin/generate-blog-draft`
   - Admin-only, OpenRouter (modello capace come claude-3.5-haiku)
   - Input: locale, topic (da content-opportunities endpoint)
   - Output: `BlogDraft` salvata in `blog:drafts`
   - NON usa `lib/blog.ts` — salva in Redis
   - Blocco: `BLOG_WEEKLY_DRAFTS=false` (default) → 503

3. **Cron settimanale**: `POST /api/cron/generate-blog-draft` (schedule: `0 9 * * 1`)
   - Chiama `GET /api/admin/content-opportunities` internamente
   - Prende il top topic per locale (EN + IT) non ancora coperto
   - Genera e salva in `blog:drafts`
   - MAI autopubblica (differente da dilemmi — richiede revisione editoriale manuale)

4. **Route pubbliche**: aggiornare `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` e `app/it/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` per leggere anche da `blog:published` Redis (in aggiunta a `lib/blog.ts` come fallback statico)

5. **Admin UI**: aggiungere tab "Blog Drafts" in `/admin` con approve/edit/reject

6. **Sitemap**: aggiornare `app/sitemap.ts` per includere articoli da `blog:published`

7. **Env var richiesto**: `BLOG_WEEKLY_DRAFTS=true` — fail closed per default

**Prerequisiti**:
- [ ] Progettare schema `BlogDraft` TypeScript (estende `BlogPost` da `lib/blog.ts`)
- [ ] Aggiornare `lib/blog.ts` per esporre funzioni di lettura/scrittura da Redis
- [ ] Prompt per blog article generation più lungo e strutturato (section-by-section)
- [ ] Admin review obbligatoria — no autopublish per blog, mai
- [ ] Quality check manuale: ogni articolo deve avere disclaimer, no AI hallucinations, link ai dilemmi reali

**NON implementare prima di**:
- Avere ≥ 20 dilemmi approvati (content base per linking)
- Aver testato content-opportunities endpoint in produzione
- Aver abilitato e testato `AUTO_PUBLISH_DILEMMAS` per almeno 7 giorni

### Sprint Precedente — Vote Integrity Hardening (27 Apr 2026)

**Integrità voto + rate limiting granulare + funnel tracking ✅**

- [x] **replaceVote atomic-safe**: Lua eval su Upstash Redis — operazione atomica in singolo round-trip, clamp automatico a ≥ 0 prima del decremento. Nessuna possibilità di decremento parziale in caso di errore.
- [x] **Rate limit voto granulare** — 3 livelli via Redis keys con TTL:
  - Tier 1 global IP: 60/ora (era 20 — alzato per compatibilità NAT); key `ratelimit:{ip}`
  - Tier 2 scenario+IP: 5 per dilemma per IP per 10 min; key `ratelimit:scenario:{id}:{ip}`
  - Tier 3 user: 120/ora per utente loggato; key `ratelimit:user:{userId}`
- [x] **Vote funnel server-side tracking** per utenti loggati: `vote_success`, `vote_change`, `vote_duplicate` (con reason: same_option/locked/race_condition), `vote_rate_limited`. Inseriti via admin client in `user_events`. Non-blocking, non bloccano il voto. Anonimi: nessun insert personale.
- [x] **ALLOWED_EVENT_TYPES** in `/api/events/track` aggiornato con i 4 nuovi event type per coerenza di schema.
- [x] Nessuna migration Supabase necessaria — `event_type` è text senza enum constraint.

---

### Sprint Precedente — Hardening Tecnico Pre-Lancio (27 Apr 2026)

**Performance + policy + bug fix ✅**

- [x] **Middleware public route optimization**: `isAuthRelevantPath()` helper — Supabase `auth.getUser()` chiamato solo su `/dashboard`, `/profile`, `/admin`, `/submit-poll`, `/api/admin/*`, `/api/missions/*`, `/api/events/*`, `/api/email/*`, `/api/stripe/portal|subscription`, `/api/me/*`. Tutte le route pubbliche (`/play/*`, `/results/*`, `/blog/*`, etc.) restituiscono `NextResponse.next()` senza roundtrip Supabase.
- [x] **AdSense official script**: rimosso proxy `/api/_g/ads` dal layout — AdSense ora carica da `pagead2.googlesyndication.com` (script ufficiale). `/api/_g/ads` resta ma non usato. Policy-safe per AdSense review.
- [x] **Fix IT "Opzione A/B"**: `optionA`/`optionB` aggiunti a EN_COPY/IT_COPY in `VoteClientPage.tsx` — IT mostra "Opzione A" / "Opzione B" invece di "Option A" / "Option B".
- [x] **Fix OG download extension**: "Save for Instagram" punta a `storyCardUrl` (PNG 9:16) invece che a `ogImageUrl` (SVG) — download attribute aggiornato a `.png`.
- [x] **migration_v9 aggiornata**: README aggiornato → ✅ Applied.

---

### Sprint Precedente — Social Content Factory Phase 2 (28 Apr 2026)

**UTM tracking, links strutturati e publish checklist ✅**

- [x] `lib/social-content.ts`: aggiunti campi opzionali backward-compatible a `SocialContentItem`:
  - `playUrl` — URL play diretto senza UTM (EN: `/play/{id}`, IT: `/it/play/{id}`)
  - `resultsUrl` — URL results per lo stesso dilemma
  - `utmUrl` — URL play con `utm_source=platform&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=soft_launch`
  - `utmSource` — valore utm_source: 'tiktok' o 'instagram'
  - `utmCampaign` — valore utm_campaign: 'soft_launch'
  - `publishChecklist` — passi manuali di pubblicazione per piattaforma (array di stringhe)
  - `priority` — `'high'` per dynamic approved, `'medium'` per statici evergreen
- [x] `scripts/generate-social-content.mjs`: aggiornato con:
  - `buildUtmUrl()`: costruisce UTM con `utm_content={id}-{locale}-{platform}`
  - `buildPublishChecklist()`: checklist 5 step per TikTok, 5 step per Instagram
  - `priority`: dynamic approved → 'high'; statici → 'medium'
  - Markdown: sezione **Links** con Play URL, Results URL, UTM URL, Story Card PNG
- [x] Zero auto-publish, zero API social, output sempre locale in `content-output/`
- [x] Verificato in locale: 20 item (5 per combo), tutti i link EN/IT corretti ✅

---

### Sprint Precedente — Social Content Factory Phase 1 (27 Apr 2026)

**Pipeline locale caption social da dilemmi approvati ✅**

- [x] `lib/social-content.ts`: tipi TypeScript `SocialContentItem`, `SocialContentBatch`, `SocialPlatform`, `SocialLocale`
- [x] `scripts/generate-social-content.mjs`: script ESM puro Node (senza tsx/ts-node)
  - `loadEnvFile()`: parser manuale `.env.local`, graceful fallback se mancante
  - `STATIC_SCENARIOS` + `IT_TRANSLATIONS`: tutti i 41 dilemmi statici EN/IT inline nel script
  - `HOOKS`: 3 hook per categoria per locale (EN/IT) — selezionati deterministicamente via `hashSeed`
  - `HASHTAGS`: array TikTok e funzione Instagram per locale e categoria
  - `buildTikTokCaption()` / `buildInstagramCaption()`: template puri, zero costo AI
  - `getDynamicApproved()`: import dinamico `@upstash/redis`, filtra `status === 'approved'`
  - `pickN()`: dedup per batch, re-use se pool < N
  - Output: `content-output/YYYY-MM-DD/social-content.{json,md}`
- [x] `package.json`: aggiunto `"generate:social-content": "node scripts/generate-social-content.mjs"`
- [x] `.gitignore`: aggiunto `/content-output/`
- [x] Verificato in locale: 20 item (5 TikTok EN + 5 Instagram EN + 5 TikTok IT + 5 Instagram IT), dynamic approved prioritizzato ✅

**Utilizzo:**
```bash
nvm use && npm run generate:social-content
# Output in content-output/YYYY-MM-DD/social-content.{json,md}
```

**⚠️ content-output/ è gitignored — mai committare output generato.**

---

### Sprint Precedente — Social Links + Referral QA (27 Apr 2026)

**Social presence + caption consistency + referral QA ✅**

- [x] `lib/social-links.ts`: costanti centralizzate per Instagram (`@splitvote.io`) e TikTok (`@splitvote8`)
- [x] `components/Footer.tsx`: link Instagram + TikTok — `target="_blank"`, `aria-label` EN/IT, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- [x] `app/layout.tsx`: Organization JSON-LD `sameAs` aggiornato con Instagram e TikTok
- [x] `app/results/[id]/ResultsClientPage.tsx`: caption TikTok e Instagram includono handle ufficiali
  - TikTok EN/IT: aggiunto `@splitvote8` prima degli hashtag
  - Instagram EN/IT: aggiunto `@splitvote.io` + ristrutturato "Link in bio" line
- [x] `README.md`: migration v8 → ✅ Applied; v9 aggiunta come ⏳ Pending; tabella missioni aggiornata
- [x] Referral QA: codice challenge_friend verificato (vedi sotto)

**Referral QA — challenge_friend:**
- ✅ `profiles.referral_code` backfillato per tutti gli utenti esistenti (migration v9)
- ✅ Nuovi profili ricevono `referral_code` via DEFAULT PostgreSQL
- ✅ `/api/referral/visit`: self-referral bloccato (`user?.id === referrerId`)
- ✅ Dedup server-side: 1 `referral_visit` per (referrer_user_id, scenario_id) per giorno
- ✅ Dedup client-side: `sessionStorage` barrier su VoteClientPage
- ✅ `challenge_friend` legge `referral_visit` da `user_events` (non più Coming Soon)
- ✅ Nessun `user_id` raw negli URL: solo `?ref=<10-hex-chars>`
- ⚠️ Visitor anonimi possono triggerare referral_visit (trade-off accettato — sessione dedup mitiga abuse casuale)
- ⚠️ RLS `profiles`: fetch `referral_code` in ResultsClientPage richiede policy `auth.uid() = user_id` (standard Supabase — già presente nelle migration esistenti)

**⚠️ Migration da applicare:**
```sql
-- Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor → supabase/migration_v9_referral_codes.sql → Run
```

---

### Sprint Precedente — challenge_friend Referral Tracking (27 Apr 2026)

**challenge_friend mission — server-verified via referral_code ✅**

- [x] `supabase/migration_v9_referral_codes.sql`: `profiles.referral_code text unique`
  - `left(replace(gen_random_uuid()::text, '-', ''), 10)` — 10 hex chars, URL-safe, non-indovinabile
  - Backfill per utenti esistenti, DEFAULT per nuovi, unique index
- [x] `POST /api/referral/visit`: endpoint senza auth visitatore
  - Admin client risolve `ref` → `referrer user_id` lato server (RLS bypass, sicuro)
  - Self-referral bloccato (visitatore autenticato con stesso `user_id`)
  - Dedup 1/giorno per (referrer, scenario_id)
  - Nessun IP o identità visitatore salvati
- [x] `VoteClientPage.tsx`: prop `referralCode`, `useEffect` chiama `/api/referral/visit` (sessionStorage dedup)
- [x] `ResultsClientPage.tsx`: fetch `referral_code` da profiles, challenge URL include `?ref=<code>`
- [x] `GET /api/missions`: `challenge_friend` rimosso da `COMING_SOON`, progress = `referralVisitsCount`
- [x] `POST /api/missions/complete`: verifica server-side `referral_visit` ≥ 1 per `challenge_friend`
- [x] `app/play/[id]/page.tsx` + `app/it/play/[id]/page.tsx`: `?ref=` passato a VoteClientPage

---

### Sprint Precedente — Share Mission + User Events Tracking (27 Apr 2026)

**share_result mission server-verified + user_events tracking ✅**

- [x] `supabase/migration_v8_user_events.sql`: nuova tabella `user_events`
  - RLS: solo utenti autenticati possono inserire/leggere i propri eventi
  - Nessun accesso anonimo — XP missions richiedono auth
  - Index su `(user_id, event_type, created_at)` per query missioni
  - ⚠️ **NON ancora applicata** — applicare manualmente in Supabase dashboard
- [x] `POST /api/events/track`: nuovo endpoint server-side
  - Allowlist: `share_result`, `copy_result_link`, `story_card_share`, `story_card_download`
  - Auth richiesta — 401 per anonimi (silenzioso nel client)
  - Dedup 60s: skip se stesso (user, type, scenario) inserito nell'ultimo minuto
- [x] `ResultsClientPage.tsx`: tracking server-side collegato a tutti gli share actions
  - Web Share API success → `share_result`
  - Clipboard fallback → `copy_result_link`
  - Story card share (file/URL) → `story_card_share`
  - Story card download (tutti i path) → `story_card_download`
  - Tracking solo su successo (mai su cancel/abort)
  - Anonimi: server restituisce 401 silenzioso, UX invariata
- [x] `GET /api/missions`: `share_result` rimosso da COMING_SOON
  - progress = count eventi share oggi (qualsiasi tipo tra i 4)
  - claimable = true se progress ≥ 1
- [x] `POST /api/missions/complete`: verifica `share_result` via `user_events`
  - Blocca se nessun evento share oggi → 403 con reason
  - Graceful failure se migration non ancora applicata (403 con istruzione)
- [x] `challenge_friend`: resta Coming Soon — nessun referral tracking
- [x] `SeedBatchPanel.tsx`: aggiunto banner "Generated drafts are not public until approved."

**⚠️ Migration da applicare:**
```sql
-- Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor → New query → incolla migration_v8_user_events.sql → Run
```

---

### Sprint Precedente — Mission Validation + Admin Seed Batch UI (27 Apr 2026)

**Mission server-validation + admin seed batch UI ✅**

- [x] `lib/missions.ts`: aggiunto `MissionState` interface (progress, required, completed, claimable, comingSoon)
- [x] `GET /api/missions`: riscritta per restituire stato completo per-missione
  - `vote_3`: conta da `dilemma_votes` oggi — server-verified
  - `vote_2_categories`: conta categorie distinte dai voti di oggi (static + dynamic lookup) — server-verified
  - `daily_dilemma`: almeno 1 voto oggi — server-verified
  - `challenge_friend`: `comingSoon: true, claimable: false` — non tracciabile lato server (ora risolto in sprint successivo)
  - `share_result`: `comingSoon: true, claimable: false` — non tracciabile lato server
- [x] `POST /api/missions/complete`: verifica server-side per `vote_2_categories`
  - Blocca `challenge_friend` e `share_result` (403 — tracking non disponibile)
  - Client non può falsificare nessuna missione verificabile
- [x] `components/DailyMissions.tsx`: UI riscritta
  - Bottone "Claim +XP" solo quando `claimable: true` dal server
  - Progress visibile: `1/3`, `0/2`, ecc.
  - Missioni coming-soon: icona 🔒, non cliccabili, badge "Coming soon"
  - Missioni completate: verde, non cliccabili
  - Errori con `aria-live`, niente crash
- [x] `app/admin/SeedBatchPanel.tsx`: nuovo componente client admin
  - Bottone "Generate 10 EN + 10 IT draft batch" che chiama `POST /api/admin/seed-draft-batch`
  - Usa sessione browser — no curl/cookie manuali
  - Loading state con warning "2-4 min"
  - Summary: total/saved/skipped_novelty/errors
  - Tabella risultati: locale, category, noveltyScore, similar, keyword, question, ID
- [x] `/admin` aggiornato con `SeedBatchPanel`
- [x] `app/dashboard/page.tsx`: rimosso prop `votesToday` (ora calcolato server-side in API)

**Regole missioni (da rispettare in ogni sprint futuro):**
- MAI fidarsi del client per completamento missioni
- `claimable: true` solo se il server verifica i requisiti
- Missioni non tracciabili → `comingSoon: true` — non mostrare come completabili
- XP awarding via DB function `award_mission_xp` con XP hardcoded — no injection

---

### Sprint Precedente — Admin Charts QA + OpenRouter Draft Queue (27 Apr 2026)

**Admin charts QA + OpenRouter save-to-draft-queue ✅**

- [x] `app/admin/AdminCharts.tsx`: empty state + 7d/14d tab toggle
  - `isEmpty` guard — mostra "Not enough data yet" invece di barre vuote
  - Tab 7d/14d con filtro client-side sull'array passato come prop
  - Nessun dato fake generato
- [x] `lib/dynamic-scenarios.ts`: aggiunto `'openrouter'` a `TrendSource`
- [x] `POST /api/admin/generate-draft`: aggiunto `mode: 'preview' | 'save'`
  - `preview` (default): comportamento precedente, non salva
  - `save`: valida, controlla noveltyScore ≥ 55 (threshold), salva in `dynamic:drafts`
  - Dedup guard: blocca save se `noveltyScore < 55` → risponde `409 low_novelty`
  - Override esplicito: `allowLowNovelty: true` nel body bypassa il blocco
  - Blog article save bloccato (→ 400 `blog_article_save_not_supported`) — richiede editing manuale
  - Metadata AI nel DynamicScenario: `trendSource: 'openrouter'`, `trendUrl: model_name`, `scores.noveltyScore`
- [x] `app/admin/GenerateDraftPanel.tsx`: Preview + Save as draft buttons
  - Bottone Preview (sempre disponibile) + Save as draft (solo dilemmi)
  - Dopo save: banner "Saved to draft queue — ID: ai-..."
  - Low novelty: banner warning con bottone "Save anyway (override dedup guard)"
  - `aria-live`, `role="alert/status"`, `aria-busy` per accessibilità
- [x] `app/admin/CronDebug.tsx`: badge AI + noveltyScore per draft OpenRouter
  - `trendSource === 'openrouter'` → badge 🤖 AI (viola)
  - `noveltyScore` mostrato se presente (verde/giallo/rosso)
- [x] `app/api/admin/dilemmas/route.ts`: espone `noveltyScore` nel response

**Regole fondamentali (da rispettare in ogni sprint futuro):**
- Tutti i contenuti generati → `status: draft`, mai autopublicati
- Admin approval obbligatoria prima che un draft entri in route pubbliche o sitemap
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` + `OPENROUTER_MODEL_DRAFT` entrambi richiesti — fail-closed
- Nessun secret o prompt nei log
- Novelty threshold: 55/100 — dedup guard blocca save sotto soglia salvo override esplicito
- Blog articles: preview-only in questa fase — editing manuale richiesto in `lib/blog.ts`
- Quest pubblicate solo con ≥3 dilemmi approvati

**Prossimo sprint: Blog article draft queue + scheduled generation**
- Blog article draft queue separata (non Redis dilemmas) — es. Supabase table o Redis key dedicata
- Cron settimanale OpenRouter per mantenere inventory fresca
- Mini quest: aggrega ≥3 dilemmi per tema → pubblica come quest
- Approved dilemmas → sitemap immediata senza redeploy

---

### Sprint Precedente — Email Test + Mobile Menu Polish (27 Apr 2026)

**Email test endpoint + mobile menu groups ✅**

- [x] `POST /api/email/test`: admin test endpoint protetto da `x-email-test-key`
  - Fail-closed se `EMAIL_TEST_KEY` mancante → 503
  - Unauthorized se header errato → 401
  - Destinatari limitati a `hello@splitvote.io` e `support@splitvote.io` — no open relay
  - Usa `sendEmail()` da `lib/email.ts`, nessun secret nei log
- [x] `MobileMenu.tsx`: menu mobile ristrutturato in 4 gruppi logici
  - Gruppo 1 — Main: Home, Trending, Blog (EN/IT)
  - Gruppo 2 — Categories: Morality/Moralità, Technology/Tecnologia, Society/Società, Relationships/Relazioni, Survival/Sopravvivenza
  - Gruppo 3 — Account: My Profile + Dashboard + Sign out (se loggato) / Join free (se anonimo)
  - Gruppo 4 — Help: FAQ, Support (mailto:support@splitvote.io)
  - "Il mio profilo" / "My Profile" rimosso dalle categorie → spostato in Account
  - Sign out button con Supabase client signOut
  - Touch targets min 44px, max-height scroll, locale-aware IT/EN, `next/link` per link interni
  - Account group appare solo dopo risoluzione auth state (no flicker)
- [x] typecheck ✅ · build (0 errori) ✅ · `git diff --check` ✅

**Istruzioni test email:**
```
curl -X POST https://splitvote.io/api/email/test \
  -H "x-email-test-key: $EMAIL_TEST_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to":"hello@splitvote.io"}'
```

---

### Sprint Precedente — Email Setup (Resend) (27 Apr 2026)

**`lib/email.ts` — safe Resend wrapper ✅**

- [x] `resend` ^6.12.2 installato
- [x] `lib/email.ts`: `sendEmail()` — `RESEND_API_KEY` da `process.env`, mai hardcoded
- [x] `EMAIL_FROM` da `process.env`, fallback pubblico `SplitVote <hello@splitvote.io>`
- [x] Fail silenzioso se `RESEND_API_KEY` mancante — `{ ok: false, error: 'email_not_configured' }`
- [x] Nessun secret nei log — solo `error.name` (enum safe), mai chiave API, mai email destinatario
- [x] `.env*.local` già gitignored
- [x] typecheck ✅ · build (138 pagine, 0 errori) ✅ · `git diff --check` ✅

**Env vars richieste in Vercel:**
```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...           # da resend.com dashboard — NEVER commit
EMAIL_FROM=SplitVote <hello@splitvote.io>   # opzionale, è il default
```

**DNS Resend da configurare su Cloudflare (per inviare da hello@splitvote.io):**
1. Vai su resend.com → Domains → Add domain → `splitvote.io`
2. Resend mostrerà 3 record DNS da aggiungere in Cloudflare:
   - `MX` record (per Resend routing in uscita)
   - `TXT` SPF record: `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all` (o simile, Resend usa SES)
   - `TXT` DKIM record: `resend._domainkey.splitvote.io` → valore CNAME fornito da Resend
3. Aggiungi i record in Cloudflare → DNS → Add Record
4. Attendi propagazione (tipicamente < 5 min con Cloudflare)
5. Clicca "Verify" in Resend dashboard
6. Testa con `resend.emails.send()` da dashboard Resend

⚠️ Nota: Cloudflare Email Routing (inbound) e Resend (outbound) coesistono — non si sovrascrivono. SPF va aggiornato per includere entrambi:
`v=spf1 include:_spf.mx.cloudflare.net include:amazonses.com ~all`

**Stato feature email:**
- `sendEmail()` pronta ma non ancora usata in nessuna route utente
- Non attivare email transazionali utente finché `RESEND_API_KEY` non è verificato in Vercel

---

### Sprint Precedente — SEO Technical Fix (27 Apr 2026)

**Fix tecnici SEO ad alto impatto ✅**

- [x] **Title deduplication**: rimosso suffisso `| SplitVote` da `app/it/page.tsx`, `app/play/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/it/play/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/results/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/it/results/[id]/page.tsx` — il template nel layout lo aggiunge automaticamente
- [x] **hreflang EN/IT su play + results**: aggiunto blocco `alternates.languages` con `en`, `it-IT`, `x-default` a tutte le route play e results (EN e IT)
- [x] **hreflang homepage normalizzato**: `app/layout.tsx` da `'it'` → `'it-IT'`; `app/it/page.tsx` aggiunto `'en': BASE_URL` per reciprocità
- [x] **SEO Landing Pages EN/IT**: `/would-you-rather-questions`, `/moral-dilemmas`, `/it/domande-would-you-rather`, `/it/dilemmi-morali` — 20 items ciascuna, schema.org `ItemList`, hreflang reciproci, sitemap aggiornata
- [x] **JSON-LD su results pages EN/IT**: `BreadcrumbList` + `Dataset` con voti reali (votes.a, votes.b, pctA, pctB) su `/results/[id]` e `/it/results/[id]`

### Sprint Precedente — QA Post-Deploy + Email/DNS Readiness (27 Apr 2026)

**Deploy QA — commit `1dc9b98` live ✅**

Route live verificate:
- [x] `/` → 200
- [x] `/it` → 200
- [x] `/play/trolley` → 200
- [x] `/it/play/trolley` → 200
- [x] `/results/trolley` → 200
- [x] `/it/results/trolley` → 200
- [x] `/site.webmanifest` → 200, JSON valido
- [x] `/offline` → 200
- [x] `/ads.txt` → 200
- [x] `/sw.js` → 200, network-first, skip /api/
- [x] `/api/cron/generate-dilemmas` (no secret) → 401 ✅
- [x] `/api/me/entitlements` (anon) → `{isAdmin:false, noAds:false, ...}` — nessun leak ADMIN_EMAILS ✅
- [x] Hotfix IT copy live: "Condividi risultato", "Prossimo dilemma" ✅

**⚠️ DNS — www/non-www mismatch da risolvere su Cloudflare:**
- `splitvote.io` → 307 → `www.splitvote.io` (Cloudflare redirect)
- Tutti i canonical/OG/sitemap nel codice usano `https://splitvote.io` (no-www)
- **Rischio SEO**: Google vede www ma canonical dice non-www → duplicate content
- **Fix Cloudflare**: Page Rule o Redirect Rule `www.splitvote.io/* → https://splitvote.io/$1` (301)
- Non richede modifiche al codice

**Email/DNS Readiness:**
- [x] `privacy@splitvote.io` — in `/privacy`, `/it/privacy` ✅
- [x] `hello@splitvote.io` — in `/faq`, `/it/faq`, `/it/terms` ✅
- [x] `legal@splitvote.io` — in `/terms` ✅
- [x] `business@splitvote.io` — in `/faq`, `/business` ✅
- [x] `research@splitvote.io` — in `/faq` ✅
- [x] `support@splitvote.io` — aggiunto in Footer (EN: "Support" / IT: "Supporto") ✅
- [x] Nessuna email personale hardcoded nel codice sorgente ✅

**Checklist Cloudflare Email Routing (da completare manualmente):**
- [ ] Nameserver Cloudflare attivi e propagati per `splitvote.io`
- [ ] Email Routing abilitato in Cloudflare dashboard
- [ ] Alias creati e forward verso Gmail testato:
  - `hello@splitvote.io`
  - `support@splitvote.io`
  - `privacy@splitvote.io`
  - `legal@splitvote.io`
  - `business@splitvote.io`
  - `research@splitvote.io`
- [ ] SPF record aggiunto: `v=spf1 include:_spf.mx.cloudflare.net ~all`
- [ ] DKIM abilitato in Cloudflare Email Routing settings
- [ ] DMARC record: `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:hello@splitvote.io`
- [ ] Forward testato end-to-end (send test email a ogni alias)
- [ ] Se serve invio outbound: configurare Resend o Postmark (SMTP nativo Cloudflare non disponibile)
- [ ] ⚠️ Correggere redirect www → non-www (vedi sopra)

**Security/Privacy QA:**
- [x] `ADMIN_EMAILS`: solo server-side in `lib/admin-auth.ts`, mai esposto al client
- [x] `CRON_SECRET`: fail-closed — restituisce 401 se mancante o errato
- [x] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: solo server-side in `lib/supabase/admin.ts`
- [x] Stripe secrets: solo `process.env.*`, nessun valore hardcoded
- [x] Tracking events (`lib/gtag.ts`): solo `scenario_id`, `category`, `locale`, `choice`, `source`, `target`, `action` — nessuna PII, nessuna email
- [x] AdSlot premium/admin no-ads: verificato via `/api/me/entitlements` ✅

**PWA/Service Worker QA:**
- [x] `site.webmanifest`: JSON valido, `display: standalone`, icon purpose separati (`any` + `maskable`), shortcuts ✅
- [x] Service worker: network-first, skip `/api/`, offline fallback su `/offline` ✅
- [x] Service worker non cachea rotte dinamiche (voti, risultati, auth) ✅
- [x] App installabile da Chrome/Safari ✅

---

### Sprint Precedente — Core Loop Retention (27 Apr 2026)

- [x] `lib/gtag.ts`: helper `track(event, params)` — thin wrapper su `window.gtag`
- [x] `lib/scenarios.ts`: `getNextScenarioId(excludeId, dynamicPool?)` — preferisce dynamic approved (top-half per finalScore), fallback statico
- [x] `results/[id]/page.tsx` + `it/results/[id]/page.tsx`: next dilemma usa pool dinamico (preferenza locale IT)
- [x] `play/[id]/page.tsx` + `it/play/[id]/page.tsx`: nextId calcolato e passato a VoteClientPage
- [x] `VoteClientPage.tsx`: prop `nextId`, "Next dilemma" linka a dilemma reale (non home), spinner loading, `track('vote_submitted')`
- [x] `ResultsClientPage.tsx`:
  - Pulsante primario Web Share API `📤 Share result` — testo punchier: `"{pct}% chose {option}. What would you do?"`
  - Fallback clipboard copy se `navigator.share` non disponibile
  - Share text più forte per WhatsApp/Telegram: usa opzione vincente/scelta
  - `track('result_viewed')` su mount
  - `track('next_dilemma_clicked')` sul CTA finale
  - `track('share_clicked', { target })` per tutti i pulsanti share
  - `track('copy_link_clicked')` su copia link
  - `track('story_card_clicked')` su share/download story
  - `<a>` back link → `<Link>` (prefetch)
- [x] `globals.css`: `animate-vote-tap` keyframe solo sotto `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`

Backlog da questo sprint:
- [ ] AdSense frequency: 1 slot ogni 3-4 voti con frequency cap — esperimento futuro, non ora
- [ ] Geo Insight privacy-safe: country da profilo volontario, aggregato anonimo, "Italy vs World" solo con campione minimo, niente IP-to-location

---

### Sprint Precedente — PWA Foundation (27 Apr 2026)

Obiettivo: fondazione tecnica comune per web + Android Play Store (TWA) + iOS App Store (Capacitor).
La PWA non è la destinazione finale — è il layer condiviso da cui TWA e Capacitor partono.

- [x] `public/site.webmanifest`: icon purpose separati (`any` + `maskable`), scope, lang, categories, shortcuts (Trending + Profile)
- [x] `app/layout.tsx`: `Viewport` export con `themeColor: '#070718'`, `viewportFit: 'cover'`
- [x] `app/layout.tsx`: `manifest: '/site.webmanifest'` in metadata, Apple PWA meta tags (`apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, `status-bar-style`, `title`)
- [x] `public/sw.js`: service worker minimal, network-first, offline fallback su `/offline`, skip `/api/`
- [x] `app/offline/page.tsx`: pagina offline branded con reload CTA
- [x] SW registration script in `<head>` via `next/script afterInteractive`

**Strategia store (sprint dedicati, NON ora):**

Android Play Store → **TWA (Trusted Web Activity)**
- Nessun WebView custom: Chrome renderizza il sito esattamente come sul web
- Richiede: `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` con SHA-256 APK signing key
- Tool: `npx @bubblewrap/cli init --manifest https://splitvote.io/site.webmanifest`
- Rischio: basso — Google Play supporta TWA esplicitamente
- Feature native minime da aggiungere prima dello store: splash polished, shortcut icone, deep link `/play/[id]`

iOS App Store → **Capacitor (WKWebView wrapper)**
- Stessa codebase web, Capacitor aggiunge bridge nativo
- Richiede: Universal Links (`apple-app-site-association`) per Supabase OAuth callback
- Feature native minime **obbligatorie** per superare Apple review:
  - Haptic feedback sul tap di voto (`@capacitor/haptics`)
  - Native share sheet (`@capacitor/share`) al posto di `navigator.share`
  - Local notification per daily dilemma reminder (`@capacitor/local-notifications`)
  - Splash screen e icon set polished (nessun "web shell" look)
- Rischio Apple review: medio — Apple rifiuta app web-shell senza valore nativo. Mitigazione: le 4 feature sopra + submission dopo crescita organica misurabile

### Sprint Precedente — i18n Personality & App Navigation (27 Apr 2026)

- [x] `lib/personality.ts`: archetype + axis IT translations (`nameIt`, `signIt`, `taglineIt`, `descriptionIt`, `traitsIt`, `shareTextIt`)
- [x] `lib/personality.ts`: `getCommunityLabel(locale)` e `getAxisLabel(locale)` locale-aware
- [x] `app/api/personality/route.ts`: `?locale=en|it` — restituisce archetype/axes/communityLabel/messages localizzati
- [x] `PersonalityClient.tsx`: fetch `/api/personality?locale=it` da `/it/personality`, share URL locale-aware
- [x] `NavLinks.tsx`: `<a>` → `<Link>` (next/link) per prefetch app-like
- [x] `MobileMenu.tsx`: link nav `<a>` → `<Link>`
- [x] `app/layout.tsx`: logo link `<a>` → `<Link>`
- [x] `app/dashboard/page.tsx`: tutti i link interni `<a>` → `<Link>`
- [x] `app/profile/ProfileClient.tsx`: "← Dashboard" `<a>` → `<Link>`
- [ ] Bottom nav mobile: valutata, rimandata a sprint UX dedicato (vedi Growth Backlog)

---

### Sprint Precedente — Expert Insight & AdBlock UX (27 Apr 2026)

- [x] `AdBlockBanner`: copy onesto — "I'll whitelist manually" / "Lo aggiungo manualmente" (non implica bypass automatico)
- [x] `AdBlockBanner`: microcopy istruzione manuale EN/IT aggiunto sotto i bottoni CTA
- [x] `lib/expert-insights.ts`: helper statico `getExpertInsight(category, locale)` — 8 categorie, EN/IT
- [x] `ResultsClientPage`: box "Expert Insight" / "Parere esperto" post-risultati con tipo esperto, testo e disclaimer
- [x] Expert Insight: nessuna AI live — template statici per sicurezza, qualità e costi zero
- [ ] AI-generated insights (backlog — richiede admin review obbligatoria, vedere sezione Growth Backlog)

---

### Sprint Precedente — Onboarding & Auth UX (27 Apr 2026)

- [x] `AuthButton`: "Sign In" → "Join free →" — copy più invitante per utenti non tecnici
- [x] `MobileMenu`: CTA auth per utenti anonimi con Supabase check + locale IT/EN
- [x] `app/login/page.tsx`: headline chiaro, 3 benefit bullets, bottoni 48px+, locale-aware IT via `?locale=it`
- [x] `ResultsClientPage`: soft CTA post-voto per anonimi (EN/IT), rilevamento via Supabase client
- [x] Branding: `app/favicon.ico` (4 icone, 113KB) ha precedenza su `public/favicon.ico` — verificato
- [ ] `/it/login` wrapper locale: non implementato (semplice redirect `?locale=it` già sufficiente)

---

### Sprint Precedente — Entitlements & Rename Flow (27 Apr 2026)

- [x] `lib/entitlements.ts` — logica centralizzata admin/premium/free
- [x] `GET /api/me/entitlements` — bridge server-side per client component
- [x] `AdSlot`: no ads per admin e premium (via entitlements API)
- [x] `api/profile/update`: admin bypass rename + premium unlimited rename
- [x] `api/stripe/checkout`: blocco admin da Stripe rename
- [x] `ProfileClient`: card "Admin Access", label rename coerente, no upgrade CTA per admin
- [x] `DashboardPage`: card "Admin Access" per admin, `canSubmitPoll` via ents
- [x] `submit-poll`: usa `/api/me/entitlements` invece di `is_premium` diretto

---

### Live / Implementato
- [x] Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vercel
- [x] Supabase Auth + profili pseudonimi (`Splitvoter-XXXXXX`)
- [x] Redis per voti real-time
- [x] Dedup voto: cookie, rate limit IP, Supabase per utenti loggati
- [x] Cambio voto entro finestra 24h senza doppio conteggio
- [x] Dashboard utente con storico voti, badge, XP/streak, companion
- [x] Companion system + daily missions
- [x] Story cards 9:16 per Instagram/TikTok manual share
- [x] Admin dashboard con metriche reali da `vote_daily_stats`
- [x] Google Search Console verificata + sitemap inviata
- [x] Logo/favicon PNG ufficiali integrati (rigenerati con AR corretta + og-default.png aggiunto)
- [x] AdBlock banner soft, non bloccante
- [x] i18n lite EN/IT con route SEO italiane
- [x] Cron EN/IT per generazione dilemmi da trend
- [x] Draft queue admin: cron genera draft, admin approva prima della pubblicazione
- [x] Feedback qualità dilemma: 🔥 / 👎 con Supabase + Redis
- [x] Sitemap locale-aware che esclude i draft

### Migration Supabase Applicate
- [x] `migration_v2_safe.sql`
- [x] `migration_v3_engagement.sql`
- [x] `migration_v4_security_hotfix.sql`
- [x] `migration_v5_vote_daily_stats.sql`
- [x] `migration_v6_feedback.sql`
- [x] `migration_v7_stripe_subscriptions.sql`

---

## Blocchi / Rischi

- [x] **Stripe MVP**: chiave revocata, env vars configurate, migration v7 applicata, webhook events verificati.
- [ ] **Build locale**: la shell di default usa Node 14; usare `nvm use` dentro questo repo.
- [ ] **Upgrade framework**: Next 16 + React 19 + Node 24 è uno sprint dedicato, non va mischiato alla push corrente.
- [ ] **Social trend sources**: X/Instagram/TikTok solo con API ufficiali o provider conformi. Niente scraping fragile.
- [ ] **Content Intelligence / Picoclaw**: Picoclaw è solo radar esterno; SplitVote Content Intelligence Agent è il gatekeeper interno read-only/dry-run. Prima fase: report duplicati, seed burnout/cooldown, category gaps, opportunità landing. Nessuna pubblicazione, save mode, commit, push o deploy automatico.
- [ ] **Legal/compliance reconciliation**: prima dello scaling aggiornare Privacy EN/IT, Terms EN/IT, cookie/storage inventory e consent UX seguendo `LEGAL.md`.
- [ ] **i18n expansion**: prossima lingua `es`, poi `pt-BR`, poi `fr`; cinese solo come progetto market-entry separato.

---

## Sprint Corrente — Viral Loop & SEO EN/IT

- [x] Ripristino visual neon home EN/IT
- [x] Sezioni home: Dilemma of the Day, Trending Now, Most Voted, Newly Generated, Browse All
- [x] `DilemmaCard` condivisa con social proof voti
- [x] Generazione dilemmi con scoring:
  - `viralScore`
  - `seoScore`
  - `noveltyScore`
  - `feedbackScore`
  - `finalScore`
- [x] Draft queue admin con approve/reject
- [x] Cron auth compatibile con Vercel `Authorization: Bearer CRON_SECRET`
- [x] Robots con `/admin/` disallow
- [x] SERP base EN/IT: route, metadata, canonical, sitemap

Da verificare post-deploy:
- [x] `/`
- [x] `/it`
- [x] `/trending`
- [x] `/it/trending`
- [ ] `/admin`
- [x] `/sitemap.xml`
- [x] `/robots.txt`
- [ ] `/api/admin/cron-dryrun?locale=en`
- [ ] `/api/admin/cron-dryrun?locale=it`

---

## Prossimo Sprint — Social Content Factory Phase 3 (Remotion Video)

Obiettivo: generare vertical video 1080×1920 MP4 dai dilemmi approvati per TikTok/Reels. **Non installare Remotion prima di iniziare questo sprint.**

**Fase 3 — Remotion vertical video**
- [ ] Installare Remotion solo quando questo sprint inizia
- [ ] Template Remotion 1080×1920 per TikTok/Reels
  - Dati: question, optionA, optionB, emoji, pctA/pctB, categoria
  - Animazioni: reveal risultati, brand colors, neon aesthetic
  - Output: MP4 in `content-output/YYYY-MM-DD/`
  - No auto-post — upload manuale sempre
- [ ] `npm run render-social <dilemmaId>` (script locale, non parte del build Vercel)
- [ ] Template EN/IT separati
- [ ] Integrazione con `generate:social-content` per batch pipeline

**Fase 3 — AI captions (sprint futuro)**
- [ ] OpenRouter caption generation (modello economico, zero costo AI)
- [ ] Output sempre `status: draft` — admin review obbligatoria
- [ ] Nessuna auto-pubblicazione mai

**Vincoli fissi (da rispettare in tutti gli sprint futuri):**
- Nessuna API Instagram/TikTok diretta
- Approvazione manuale obbligatoria prima di qualsiasi post
- Output locale o Supabase — niente publish automatico

---

Prerequisito:
- [x] Revocare chiave Stripe compromessa
- [x] Aggiungere nuova `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in Vercel
- [x] Aggiungere/validare `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- [x] Aggiungere `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PREMIUM`
- [x] Applicare `migration_v7_stripe_subscriptions.sql`

Scope:
- [x] Premium monthly subscription
- [x] Customer portal
- [x] Webhook robusto per subscription lifecycle
- [x] UI upgrade/downgrade in dashboard/profile
- [x] Gate premium coerenti

---

## Sprint Upgrade Tecnico

Non fare insieme a feature/product sprint.

- [ ] Usare solo runtime di progetto (`nvm use`), senza cambiare default globale
- [ ] Valutare Node 24 LTS in `.nvmrc`
- [ ] Upgrade Next 14 → Next 16
- [ ] Upgrade React 18 → React 19
- [ ] Upgrade ESLint config a stack compatibile Next 16
- [ ] Applicare eventuali codemod App Router (`params/searchParams`)
- [ ] Build locale con Node moderno
- [ ] Deploy preview prima di produzione

---

## Growth Backlog

- [ ] Admin scoring dashboard con breakdown di viral/SEO/novelty/feedback
- [ ] Weekly digest email
- [ ] Friend challenge leaderboard
- [ ] **Content QA/refusi**: controllo periodico static + dynamic approved, soprattutto IT e contenuti AI approvati
- [ ] **Spanish localization (`es`)**: route `/es`, static scenarios, play/results/category/blog/legal/personality, hreflang, sitemap, Social Content Factory captions
- [ ] **Brazilian Portuguese localization (`pt-BR`)**: dopo ES stabile; tono Brazil-first, non portoghese generico
- [ ] **French localization (`fr`)**: dopo PT-BR, con legal/cookie copy review
- [ ] **Chinese localization (`zh-CN`)**: solo con strategia dedicata di distribuzione, legal/privacy e cultural review
- [ ] Media kit pubblico con insight aggregati
- [ ] API read-only per ricercatori
- [ ] Video share cards animate
- [ ] Referral system
- [ ] **Pixie cosmetic system (Phases 3–5)** — strategy documented in `PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md → Pixie Digital Avatar Direction`; `equipped_frame`, `equipped_badge` già in DB; Phase 3 adds `pixie_variant_equipped`; Phase 5 adds `user_pixie_skins` table + Stripe + LEGAL review
- [ ] Moral profile compatibility tra amici
- [ ] Zodiac/ascendant overlay opzionale sul moral profile
- [ ] Idempotenza webhook Stripe: storico `session_id` già processati in DB per evitare doppio increment `name_changes`
- [ ] **Expert Insight AI**: generare insight da AI (OpenRouter, modello economico) solo per draft approvati — cache nel record dilemma, admin review obbligatoria, mai live on user request, guardrail per categorie health/legal
- [ ] **Expert Insight store**: colonna `expert_insight_en` / `expert_insight_it` su tabella dilemmas per insight curati manualmente o approvati da admin
- [ ] **Bottom nav mobile**: Home / Trending / Play / Profilo — solo mobile, locale-aware, safe-area, non copre contenuto
- [ ] **AdSense frequency experiment**: mostrare 1 ad ogni 3-4 voti con frequency cap — non bloccare CTA, non interstitial, A/B test
- [ ] **Geo Insight privacy-safe**: "Italy vs World" — country da profilo volontario, aggregato anonimo, soglia minima campione, niente IP-to-location senza base legale
- [ ] **Android TWA (Play Store)**: `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` + APK firmato + Google Play listing — Bubblewrap CLI, SHA-256 signing key, deep link `/play/[id]`
- [ ] **iOS Capacitor (App Store)**: Capacitor bridge, Universal Links per Supabase OAuth, haptics + native share + local notifications + splash — prerequisito: crescita organica misurabile per ridurre rischio Apple review
