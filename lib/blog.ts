        q: 'What is a moral dilemma?',
        a: "A moral dilemma is a situation where two genuine values collide and you can only honour one. Both options have real consequences, neither is clearly wrong on ethical grounds, and the choice reveals which value you actually prioritise — not which one you say you do. A hard problem is not automatically a dilemma; it becomes one only when the two sides are both defensible.",
      },
      {
        q: 'What are some real-life examples of moral dilemmas?',
        a: "Beyond the classic trolley problem, real-life moral dilemmas include telling a friend their partner is cheating, reporting a close friend for a serious crime, accepting an inheritance from someone you considered immoral, deciding whether a doctor should reveal a devastating diagnosis, and choosing between saving a relative or a stranger who could help many others. The shared shape is the same: two values you hold, one decision that cannot honour both.",
      },
      {
        q: 'What is the most famous moral dilemma?',
        a: "The trolley problem, introduced by philosopher Philippa Foot in 1967, is the most cited moral dilemma in modern ethics. A runaway trolley will kill five people unless you divert it to kill one. The split among voters is far more balanced than most people expect before they actually have to choose — which is precisely why it has lasted for decades as a teaching tool.",
      },
      {
        q: 'Are moral dilemmas only philosophical thought experiments?',
        a: "No — most real moral dilemmas happen in everyday life, not in philosophy classrooms. They appear in workplaces (cover for a colleague or report them?), families (tell the truth or protect someone from pain?), medicine (full disclosure or compassionate filtering?), and law (loyalty to a friend or to justice?). The thought experiments simplify these everyday tensions so they can be analysed; the underlying conflicts are real.",
      },
      {
        q: 'Why do people answer moral dilemmas so differently?',
        a: "Because people implicitly use different ethical frameworks. Consequentialists weigh outcomes (the most lives saved wins). Deontologists weigh actions themselves (some acts are wrong regardless of consequences). Virtue ethicists ask what a person of integrity would do. Most people carry all three frameworks at once — until a dilemma forces them into direct conflict, and then one framework wins. Vote splits of 40/60 or 45/55 across thousands of voters reflect this underlying disagreement, not confusion.",

        q: "What's the difference between loyalty and honesty?",
        a: "Both are moral virtues, but they answer different questions. Loyalty asks who you protect; honesty asks what you say. Most of the time the two coexist quietly. They collide when staying loyal to someone you care about requires concealing the truth from someone else — and at that point you have to pick a side.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is truth vs loyalty really a moral dilemma?",
        a: "Yes — and one of the most common in real life. A true dilemma isn't a choice between right and wrong; it's a choice between two things you actually value. Truth vs loyalty fits that test exactly: both options leave a moral remainder — guilt, regret, or unfinished obligation — that you have to live with.",
      },
      {
        q: "When does loyalty stop being a virtue?",
        a: "Most people carry an implicit hierarchy: loyalty to close family outweighs loyalty to friends, which outweighs loyalty to institutions, which outweighs abstract honesty principles. The hierarchy shifts with the severity of the wrong. Helping a friend cover a parking fine is different from covering a fatal accident — and most people's loyalty has a breaking point they rarely know until they hit it.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is it better to be loyal or honest?",
        a: "Neither is automatically better — the right balance depends on the stakes and the people involved. A useful test: imagine the person you'd be lying to (or staying silent in front of) found out months later. Would they understand your loyalty as care, or experience it as betrayal? When loyalty would be experienced as betrayal by someone who also deserved care, honesty usually wins.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can you be loyal and honest at the same time?",
        a: "Yes, most of the time — the two virtues only collide in specific situations, not by default. The honest move that preserves loyalty is usually to say the hard truth privately to the person you are loyal to, before circumstances force a public choice. Loyalty does not require silence; it requires care. Honesty does not require broadcasting; it requires not deceiving.",

        q: 'Cos\'è un dilemma morale?',
        a: "Un dilemma morale è una situazione in cui due valori veri si scontrano e puoi onorarne uno solo. Entrambe le opzioni hanno conseguenze reali, nessuna è chiaramente sbagliata sul piano etico, e la scelta rivela quale valore privilegi davvero — non quale dici di privilegiare. Un problema difficile non è automaticamente un dilemma: lo diventa quando i due lati sono entrambi difendibili.",

      {
        q: 'Quali sono esempi reali di dilemmi morali?',
        a: "Oltre al classico problema del tram, i dilemmi morali della vita reale includono dire a un amico che il suo partner lo tradisce, denunciare un amico stretto per un reato grave, accettare un'eredità da una persona che ritenevi immorale, decidere se un medico debba rivelare una diagnosi devastante, scegliere tra salvare una persona cara o uno sconosciuto che potrebbe aiutarne molti. La forma è sempre la stessa: due valori che tieni entrambi, una decisione che non può onorarli tutti e due.",
      },
      {
        q: 'Qual è il dilemma morale più famoso?',
        a: "Il problema del tram, introdotto dalla filosofa Philippa Foot nel 1967, è il dilemma morale più citato dell'etica moderna. Un tram fuori controllo ucciderà cinque persone a meno che tu non lo devii a uccidere una sola persona. La divisione tra chi vota è molto più equilibrata di quanto ci si aspetti prima di dover scegliere davvero — ed è proprio per questo che è rimasto uno strumento didattico per decenni.",
      },
      {
        q: 'I dilemmi morali sono solo esperimenti filosofici?',
        a: "No — la maggior parte dei dilemmi morali reali avviene nella vita di tutti i giorni, non nelle aule di filosofia. Si presentano al lavoro (coprire un collega o denunciarlo?), in famiglia (dire la verità o proteggere qualcuno dal dolore?), in medicina (rivelare tutto o filtrare con compassione?), in giustizia (essere leali a un amico o alla legge?). Gli esperimenti filosofici semplificano queste tensioni quotidiane per poterle analizzare, ma i conflitti sottostanti sono reali.",
      },
      {
        q: 'Perché le persone rispondono ai dilemmi morali in modo così diverso?',
        a: "Perché usano implicitamente quadri etici diversi. I consequenzialisti pesano i risultati (vince ciò che salva più vite). I deontologi pesano le azioni in sé (alcuni atti sono sbagliati indipendentemente dalle conseguenze). L'etica delle virtù chiede cosa farebbe una persona integra. La maggior parte di noi porta dentro tutti e tre i quadri contemporaneamente — finché un dilemma li mette in conflitto diretto, e a quel punto ne vince uno. Le divisioni di voto 40/60 o 45/55 su migliaia di utenti riflettono questo disaccordo strutturale, non confusione.",
